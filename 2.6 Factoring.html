<h1>2.6 Factoring</h1>
<p>We should probably add an example of factoring a difference of squares. Expanding conjugate pairs is introduced at the end of Section 2.2.</p>
<h3>What is a factor?</h3>
<p>When two quantities are multiplied together we refer to them as factors. For example,</p>

<ul>
    <li>The expression \(3\cdot x\) involves two factors: 3 and\(x\).</li>
    <li>The expression \(7xy(x+3)\) involves 4 factors. The four quantities being multiplied together are: \(7\),\(x\),\(y\), and \(x+3\). </li>
</ul>

<p>To identify the factors in a more complicated expression like the last one, it can be helpful to think about where the implied multiplication symbols are in the expression. \(7xy(x+3)=7 \cdot x \cdot y \cdot (x+3)\).</p>

<h3>Identifying Factors.</h3>
<p>Is \(3\) a factor of \(15\)? To answer this question, we have to ask ourselves, can we write \(15\) as the result of \(3\) and some other factor multiplied together? Can we find something to replace this question mark: \(3 \cdot  ? =15\). We can! \(3 \cdot 5=15\). So we know that \(3\) is a factor of \(15\).</p>

<p>Is \(7x\) a factor of \(-21x^2\). We ask ourselves the same question as above. Can we find something to replace this question mark: \(7x \cdot ?=-21x^2\). We can! \(7x \cdot (-3x)=7 \cdot (-3) \cdot x \cdot x=-21x^2\). So \(7x\) is a factor of \(-21x^2\).</p>

<h3>What does it mean to factor something?</h3>
<p>To factor a quantity or an expression is to write as two other quantities multiplied together. For example, there are multiple ways to factor the number \(16\). We can write any of the following \(16=1 \cdot 16\), \(16=2 \cdot 8\), or \(16 = 4 \cdot 4\). As this example illustrates, there can be several different, valid ways to factor something.</p>

<p>We can think about factoring numbers, but we can also think about factoring expressions as well. Consider\(6x\). There are multiple ways about thinking of \(6x\) as being two simpler expressions multiplied together:</p>

\begin{align}
    6x &= 6 \cdot x \\
    6x &= 2 \cdot 3x \\
    6x & = 3x \cdot 2 \\
    6x &= 2 \cdot 3 \cdot x
\end{align}

<p>You can probably come up with some additional ways to factor \(6x\) beyond those written here.</p>

<p>Note that factoring involves expressing a quantity as the product of other quantities. Although we could write \(6x=2x+3x\), this would not be considered a way to factor \(6x\).</p>

<p>In mathematics, it can be easier sometimes to work with an expression in a factored form. For example, if you were asked to evaluate these two expressions for \(x=2\) by hand, which would find easier to work with?</p>

<p>\((2x-1)(x+3)\) or \(2x^2+5x-3\) ?</p>

<p>\((2x-1)(x+3)\) for \(x=2\) <br />\((2 \cdot 2-1)(2+3)\)<br />\((4-1)(5)\)<br />\((3)(5)\)<br />\(15\)</p>
<p>\(2x^2+5x-3\) for\(x=2\)<br />\(2 \cdot 2^2+5 \cdot 2-3\)<br />\(2 \cdot 4+5 \cdot 2-3\)<br />\(8+10-3\)<br />\(18-3\)<br />\(15\)</p>

<p>The first one involves slightly less complicated operations. It turns out that these two expressions are equivalent to each other. The first one is just in a factored form.</p>

<h3>Factoring out the Common Factors</h3>
<p>One common way to put an expression into a factored form is to identify and factor out any factors that are in common to all of the terms in the expression.</p>

<p>Think about the integers \(8\) and \(12\). Can you think of any integer that is a factor of both \(8\) and \(12\)? The integer \(2\) would fit that description. \(2\) is a factor of \(8\) since \(8=2 \cdot 4\) and \(2\) is also a factor of \(12\) since \(12=2(6)\). So \(2\) is a common factor of \(8\) and \(12\). However, there is another, larger integer, that is also a common factor of \(8\) and \(12\): \(4\). \(4\) is a factor of \(8\) since \(8=4 \cdot 2\) and \(4\) is also a factor of \(12\) since \(12=4 \cdot 3\). There is no other common factor of \(8\) and \(12\) that would be larger than \(4\), so \(4\) is the greatest common factor (GCF) of \(8\) and \(12\).</p>

<p>We can also think about common factors with algebraic expressions. Think about the expressions\(6x^2\) and \(9x^3\). What is the greatest common factor of these two expressions? In terms of the number factors, we can see that both \(6x^2\) and \(9x^3\) have a factor of 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>\(6x^2 = 3 \cdot 2x^2\)</li>
<li>\(9x^3 = 3 \cdot 3x^2\)</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of variables, we can also see that\(6x^2\) and\(9x^3\) both have a factor of \(x^2\).</p>
<ul>
<li>\(6x^2 = x^2 \cdot 6\)</li>
<li>\(9x^3 = x^2 \cdot 9x\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting these observations together, we have found the greatest common factor of\(6x^2\) and \(9x^3\) to be \(3x^2.\)</p>
<ul>
<li>\(6x^2 = 3x^2 \cdot 2\)</li>
<li>\(9x^3 = 3x^2 \cdot 3x\)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we were looking at the expression \(6x^2-9x^3\) we could factor this expression by identifying, and then factoring out, the greatest common factor. Factoring our the greatest common factor can be thought of as "un-dstributing."</p>
<p>\(6x^2-9x^2\)</p>
<p>\(=3x^2 \cdot 2-3x^2 \cdot 3 x\)</p>
<p>\(=3x^2(2-3x)\)</p>
<p>Notice that if we were to take our result and distribute the \(3x^2\) we would exactly reverse our steps.</p>
<p>\(3x^2(2-3x)\)</p>
<p>\(=3x^2 \cdot 2-3x^2 \cdot 3x\)</p>
<p>\(=6x^2-9x^3\)</p>

<h3>Factoring trinomials</h3>
<h3>Factoring a Trinomial with Leading Coefficient 1</h3>
<p>Although we should always begin by looking for a GCF, pulling out the GCF is not the only way that polynomial expressions can be factored. The polynomial \(x^2+5x+6\) has a GCF of 1, but it can be written as the product of the factors (\(x\) + 2) and (\(x\) + 3). We can check this using the FOIL method to multiply:</p>
<p>\((x+2)(x+3)= x^2+2x+3x+6=x^2+5x+6\)</p>

<p>We can factor trinomials of the form \(x^2+bx+c\)by finding two numbers with a product of c and a sum of b.</p>
<p>The trinomial \(x^2+10x+16\), for example, can be factored using the numbers 2 and 8 because the product of those numbers is 16 and their sum is 10. We can then rewrite the trinomial as the product of (\(x\) + 2) and (\(x\) + 8).</p>
<p>\(x^2+10x+16=(x+2)(x+10)\)</p>

<p>Factoring a Trinomial with Leading Coefficient 1</p>
<p>A trinomial of the form \(x^2+bx+c\)can be written in factored form as \((x + p)(x + q)\)</p>
<p>where \( p \cdot  q = c\) and \(p + q = b\).</p>

<p>Given a trinomial in the form \(x^2+bx+c\), we factor it by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>List factors of c.</li>
<li>Find p and q, a pair of factors of c that also have a sum of b.</li>
<li>Write the factored expression (\(x\) + p)(\(x\) + q).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Factor \(x^2+2x-15\).</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>We have a trinomial with leading coefficient 1, b = 2, and c = -15. We need to find two numbers with a product of -15 and a sum of 2. We list factors of -15 until we find a pair with the desired sum.</p>
<p>Factors of -15</p>
<p>Sum of Factors</p>
<p>1, -15</p>
<p>-14</p>
<p>-1, 15</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>3, -5</p>
<p>-2</p>
<p>-3, 5</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>The correct pair is the last set. Now that we have identified p and q as -3 and 5, we write the factored form as</p>
<p>\((x - 3)(x + 5)\)</p>
<p>We can check our work by multiplying. Use FOIL to confirm that \((x - 3)(x + 5) =x^2+2x-15\).</p>
<h3>Further Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li>Factor\(x^2-4x-21\)</li>
</ol>
<p>We look for a pair of numbers whose product is -21 and whose sum is -4.</p>
<p>We find (-7)(3) = -21 and -7 + 3 = -4.</p>
<p>So the factors of are (x - 7) and (\(x\) + 3).</p>
<p>Check: \((x-7)(x+3)=x^2-4x-21\)</p>
<ol>
<li>Factor\(x^2+9x+8\)</li>
</ol>
<p>We look for a pair of numbers whose product is 8 and whose sum is 9.</p>
<p>We find (8)(1) = 8 and 8 + 1 = 9.</p>
<p>So the factors of are (x +8) and (\(x\) + 1).</p>
<p>Check:\((x+8)(x+1)=x^2+9x+8\)</p>
<ol>
<li>Factor \(x^2-13x+30\)</li>
</ol>
<p>We look for a pair of numbers whose product is 30 and whose sum is -13.</p>
<p>We find (-10)( -3) = 30 and -10 + -3 = -13.</p>
<p>So the factors of are (x - 10) and (\(x\) - 3).</p>
<p>Check: \((x-10)(x-3)=x^2-13x+30\)</p>
<ol>
<li>Factor \(x^2+5x-2\)</li>
</ol>
<p>We look for a pair of numbers whose product is -2 and whose sum is 5.</p>
<p>We find there are no integers that satisfy these conditions. So this polynomial and cannot be factored.</p>
<p>Not every trinomial can be factored as a product of binomials. Some polynomials cannot be factored. These polynomials are said to be prime.</p>
