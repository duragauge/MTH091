<h1>5.2 Understanding Slope</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>If you've ever been walking, hiking or biking in a hilly area then you know that not all trails are flat!  Trails have various inclines; some extreemly steep and others relativly level.</p>

<p>Lines are the same; they can rise rapidly or drop gradually or anything in between. That change in elevation is measured and understood using the concept of <strong>slope</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Concept of Slope</h3>
<p>In the case of our trail, how could you describe its steepness? One way would be to measure how much the trail rises or falls over a fixed distance, like \(100\) meters.  If you found that one section rises \(15\) meters for every \(100\) meters you move forward then you'd know it is steeper than a section that only rise \(5\) meters over the same distance. This would allow you to compare the steepness of different trail segments.</p>

<p>Slope is a measure of how rapidly lines change and it works exactly the same way. We even use similar words.  Slope is often described as "rise-over-run", where "rise" means the vertical change and "run" is the horizontal change.</p>

<p>In our trail example, "rise" is the vertical change in elevation while the "run" is the horizontal distance covered. If we divide the rise by the run (which is what "rise-<b>over</b>-run" literally means) then we get a ratio indicating the vertical change for every unit change horizontally.</p>

<p>Because of this, slope is often refered to as a "rate of change" or a "per unit change".  Things like miles <em>per</em> gallon, servings <em>per</em> package, dollars <em>per</em> hour, or feet <em>per</em> second are examples of rates of change.
    

<h4>Calculating Slope</h4>
<p>Usually, we use the letter \(m\) to represent slope and, if we know the rise and run, then \(m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}).</p>

<p>For instance, if a trail rises \(20\) meters for every \(100\) meters you move forward, the slope would be</p>

\begin{align}
    m &= \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \\
    &= \frac{20}{100} \\
    &= \frac{1}{5}
\end{align}

<p>If the rise and run are not provided, which is generally the case, we will have to find them.  The best way to do this is to identify the coordinates of two points \(x_1,y_1\) and \(x_2,y_2\) on the line.  Since rise is a vertical change, it could be found by subtracting the \(y\)-coordinates.  Run could be calculated in a similar way by subtracting the two \(x\)-coordinates.</p>

    <strong>Slope Formula:</strong>
    <p>If \(x_1,y_1\) and \(x_2,y_2\) are two points a line, then the slope of that line is</p>
    \begin{align}
        m = \frac{ \text{rise} } { \text{run} } = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}>
</div>


<h3>Calculating Slope: Example</h3>
<p>Let's consider two points \((2, 5)\) and \((5, 9)\) on a line. Using the slope formula:</p>
<div style="min-width:600px;width:80%; margin:1.2em; background:#f0f8ff; border-radius:15px; border:2px solid #0066ff;  padding:5px 10px 10px 10px;">
    \(\begin{align}
        m &= \frac{{y_2 - y_1}}{{x_2 - x_1}} \\
        &= \frac{{9 - 5}}{{5 - 2}} \\
        &= \frac{4}{3}
    \end{align}\)
</div>
<p>The slope between these two points is \(m = \frac{4}{3}\). This means that for every 3 units of horizontal change, there is a corresponding 4 units of vertical change.</p>







<h3>Practical Applications</h3>
<p>Slope is utilized in various real-world scenarios, from architecture and urban planning (such as determining the slope of wheelchair ramps) to calculating rates (like steps per minute or elevation gain per hour while hiking). It's a fundamental concept that helps us comprehend changes and relationships in different contexts.</p>

<p>Now that we have a clear understanding of what slope signifies and how to compute it, let's delve into how it plays a pivotal role in graphing lines using the slope-intercept form.</p>

<h3>Slope's Significance</h3>
<p>Slope has significant implications. Positive slope (\(m > 0\)) indicates an upward slant from left to right, while negative slope (\(m < 0\)) indicates a downward slant. A slope of 0 (\(m = 0\)) means the line is horizontal.</p>

<p>Understanding slope is crucial for graphing and analyzing linear relationships. In the next section, we'll explore the slope-intercept form, which provides a powerful way to graph lines based on their slope and y-intercept.</p>
