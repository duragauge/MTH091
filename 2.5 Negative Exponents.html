<h1>2.5 Negative Exponents</h1>
<h3>Zero Exponents and Negative Exponents</h3>
<h3>The Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents</h3>
<p>Let’s return to the quotient rule. We made the condition that \(m \gt n \) so that the difference \(>m - n\) would never be zero or negative. What would happen if \(m = n\)? For example, let’s simplify the expression \(b^3/b^3\). If we were to simplify this expression using the quotient property, we would have this: \(b^(3-3)=b^0\)</p>
<p>If we view the expression in a different way, we will remember that any number divided by itself is equal to \(1\). That means:\(b^3/b^3=1\)</p>
<p>If we equate the two answers, the result is: \(b^0=1\)</p>
<p>This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing such a number.</p>
<h5>The Zero Exponent Rule</h5>
<p>For any nonzero real number \(b\), \(b^0=1\)</p>
< 
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify each expression.</p>
<p>1. \(a^4b^0=a^4 \cdot \1=a^4\)</p>
<p>2. \(\frac{x^3 \cdot \y^5}{x^3}=x^0y^5=1 \cdot y^5=y^5\)</p>
<p>Recall that any number times \(1\) equals itself (\(1 \cdot a = a\)) and that we do not need to write the number \(1\) when it is a coefficient.</p>
<h3>The Negative Integer Rule of Exponents</h3>
<p>Another useful result occurs if we explore the results when \(m \lt n\) in the quotient property. For example, let’s simplify \(b^4/b^7\). Begin by using the definition of an exponent.</p>
\(b^4/b^7\)
<p>=</p>
\((b \cdot \b \cdot \b \cdot \b)/(b \cdot \b \cdot \b \cdot \b \cdot \b \cdot \b \cdot \b)\)
<p>Definition of exponent.</p>
 
<p>=</p>
\((1 \cdot \1 \cdot \1 \cdot \1)/(b \cdot \b \cdot \b)\)
<p>Divide:\(b/b=1\)</p>
 
<p>=</p>
\(1/b^3\)
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>If we simplify the original expression using the quotient property, we have</p>
<p>\(b^4/b^7= b^(4-7) =b^-3\)</p>
<p>Putting the answers together, we have \(b^-3=1/b^3\).</p>
<p>This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing a nonzero real number.</p>
<h5>The Negative Integer Rule of Exponents</h5>
<p>For any nonzero real number b and natural number n, the negative rule of exponents states that</p>
<p>\(b^-n=1/b^n\)</p>
< 
<p>For the quotient \(b^m/m^n\), when \(m \lt n\), we can use the negative rule of exponents to simplify the expression to its reciprocal because the difference \(m - n\) is negative. A factor with a negative exponent becomes the same factor with a positive exponent if we move it moved across the fraction bar, from numerator to denominator or vice versa.</p>
<p>\(b^{-n}=\frac{1}{b^n}\) and \(\frac{1}{b^{-n}}=b^n\)</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify. Write answers with positive exponents.</p>
<p>1. \(\frac{c^3}{c^{10}}=c^{3-10}=c^{-7}=\frac{1}{c^7}\)</p>
<p>2.\(b^2 \cdot b^-8 = b^{2-8}=b^{-6}=\frac{1}{b^6} \)</p>
<p>3.\(\frac{4a^{-5}}{b^{-3}}=\frac{4b^3}{a^5}\)</p>
<p>4.\(\frac{-3a^8 \cdot b^5}{b^9}=-3a^8 \cdot b^-4=\frac{-3a^8}{b^4}\)</p>
<p>Be careful! Notice in the last example, the coefficient, \(-3\), is a negative number, not a negative exponent.</p>
<h3>Scientific Notation</h3>
<p>A shorthand method of writing very small and very large numbers is called scientific notation. This expresses numbers in terms of exponents of \(10\). To write a number in scientific notation, you move the decimal point to the right of the first non-zero digit in the number until you can write the digits as a decimal number between \(1\) and \(10\). Count the number of places, n, that you moved the decimal point. You then multiply the decimal number by \(10\) raised to a power of \(n\). The sign of \(n\)(positive or negative) depends on whether you moved the decimal point in the standard form of the number to the right or to the left.</p>
<p>Scientific Notation</p>
<p>A number is written in scientific notation if it is written in the form \(a \times 10^n\),</p>
<p>where\(1 \lt a \lt 10\) and \(n\)is an integer.</p>
< 
<ul>
<li>If you move the decimal point to the left, as with a large number, then \(n\)is positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, consider the number \(2,780,418\). This is a whole number so the decimal point is understood to be to the right of the digit in the ones column. We need to move this decimal point between the \(2\) and the \(7\).</p>
<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip1-1686780700560.png"/></p>
<p>We moved the decimal point \(6\) places to the left, so the exponent on base \(10\) is positive \(6\). The exponent is positive because the original number was greater than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(2,780,418 = 2.780418 \times 10^6\)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you move the decimal point to the right, as with a small number, then \(n\)is negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take, for example, the radius of an electron, \(0.00000000000047\). Perform the same series of steps as above, except move the decimal point to the right. Be careful to not include the leading \(0\) in your count.</p>
<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip0-1686781048978.png"/></p>
<p>We move the decimal point \(13\) places to the right, so the exponent of \(10\) is \(-13\). The exponent is negative because the value of the original number is less than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(0.00000000000047=4.7 \ times 10^{-13}\)</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Write each number in scientific notation.</p>
<p>1. Distance to Andromeda Galaxy from Earth: \(24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\) meters</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 22 places to the left, (between the \(2\) and \(4\)) in order to have a number between \(1\) and \(10\). The exponent on base \(10\) will be positive because the given distance is greater than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 2.4 \times 10^{22}\)</p>
<p>2. Average distance between Earth and the Sun: \(92,960,000\) meters</p>
<p>We move the decimal point \(7\) places to the left, (between the \(9\) and \(2\) in order to have a number between \(1\) and \(10\). The exponent on base \(10\) will be positive because the given distance is greater than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(92,960,000 = 9.296 \times 10^7\)</p>
<p>3. One picometer is approximately \(0.00000000003397\) inches</p>
<p>We move the decimal point \(11\) places to the right, (between the \(3\)'s) in order to have a number between \(1\) and \(10\). The exponent on base \(10\) will be negative because the given length is less than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(0.00000000003397 = 3.397 \times 10^{-11}\)</p>
<p>4. Probability of being struck by lightning in any single year: \(0.00000143\)</p>
<p>We move the decimal point \(6\) places to the left, (between the \(1\) and \(4\) in order to have a number between \(1\) and \(10\). The exponent on base \(10\) will be negative because the given distance is greater than \(1\).</p>
<p>\(0.00000143 =1.43 \times 10^{-6}\)</p>
<h5> </h5>
<h5>Write each number in standard decimal notation.</h5>
<p>5. One light year is approximately \(5.88 \times  10^{12}\) miles.</p>
<p>We move the decimal point \(12\) places to the right as indicated by a positive exponent.</p>
<p>\(5.88 \times  10^12 = 5,880,000,000,000\)</p>
<p>6. The mass of a particle of dust is about \(7.53 \times  10^{-10}\) kilograms.</p>
<p>\(7.53\times 10^{-10}=0.000000000753\)</p>
