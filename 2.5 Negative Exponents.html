<h1>2.5 Negative Exponents</h1>
<h3>Zero Exponents and Negative Exponents</h3>
<h3>The Zero Exponent Rule of Exponents</h3>
<p>Let’s return to the quotient rule. We made the condition that <em>m</em> &gt; <em>n</em> so that the difference <em>m</em> - <em>n</em> would never be zero or negative. What would happen if <em>m</em> = <em>n</em>? For example, let’s simplify the expression \(b^3/b^3\). If we were to simplify this expression using the quotient property, we would have this: \(b^(3-3)=b^0\)</p>
<p>If we view the expression in a different way, we will remember that <em><strong>any number divided by itself is equal to 1</strong></em>. That means:\(b^3/b^3=1\)</p>
<p>If we equate the two answers, the result is: \(b^0=1\)</p>
<p>This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing such a number.</p>
<h5>The Zero Exponent Rule</h5>
<p>For any nonzero real number<em> b</em>, \(b^0=1\)</p>
< 
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify each expression.</p>
<p><strong>1. \( \)</strong>\(a^4b^0=a^4*1=a^4\)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>\((x^3*y^5)/x^3=x^0y^5=1*y^5=y^5\)</p>
<p>Recall that any number times 1 equals itself (1<em>a</em> = <em>a</em>) and that we do not need to write the number 1 when it is a coefficient.</p>
<h3>The Negative Integer Rule of Exponents</h3>
<p>Another useful result occurs if we explore the results when <em>m</em> &lt; <em>n</em> in the quotient property. For example, let’s simplify \(b^4/b^7\). Begin by using the definition of an exponent.</p>
\(b^4/b^7\)
<p>=</p>
\((b*b*b*b)/(b*b*b*b*b*b*b)\)
<p>Definition of exponent.</p>
 
<p>=</p>
\((1*1*1*1)/(b*b*b)\)
<p>Divide:\(b/b=1\)</p>
 
<p>=</p>
\(1/b^3\)
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>If we simplify the original expression using the quotient property, we have</p>
<p>\(b^4/b^7= b^(4-7) =b^-3\)</p>
<p>Putting the answers together, we have \(b^-3=1/b^3\).</p>
<p>This is true for any nonzero real number, or any variable representing a nonzero real number.</p>
<h5>The Negative Integer Rule of Exponents</h5>
<p>For any nonzero real number <em>b</em> and natural number <em>n</em>, the negative rule of exponents states that</p>
<p>\(b^-n=1/b^n\)</p>
< 
<p>For the quotient \(b^m/m^n\), when <em>m</em> &lt; <em>n</em>, we can use the negative rule of exponents to simplify the expression to its reciprocal because the difference <em>m</em> - <em>n</em> is negative. A factor with a negative exponent becomes the same factor with a positive exponent if we move it moved across the fraction bar, from numerator to denominator or vice versa.</p>
<p>\(b^-n=1/b^n\) and \(1/b^-n=b^n\)</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify. Write answers with positive exponents.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>\(c^3/c^10=c^(3-10)=c^-7=1/c^7\)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>\(b^2b^-8=b^(2-8)=b^-6=1/b^6\)</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>\((4a^-5)/b^-3=(4b^3)/a^5\)</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong>\((-3a^8b^5)/b^9=-3a^8b^-4=(-3a^8)/b^4\)</p>
<p>Be careful! Notice in the last example, the coefficient, -3, is a negative <em>number</em>, not a negative <em>exponent</em>.</p>
<h3>Scientific Notation</h3>
<p>A shorthand method of writing very small and very large numbers is called <strong>scientific notation</strong>. This expresses numbers in terms of exponents of 10. To write a number in scientific notation, you move the decimal point to the right of the first non-zero digit in the number until you can write the digits as a decimal number between 1 and 10. Count the number of places, <em>n</em>, that you moved the decimal point. You then multiply the decimal number by 10 raised to a power of <em>n</em>. The sign of <em>n</em> (positive or negative) depends on whether you moved the decimal point in the standard form of the number to the right or to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Notation</strong></p>
<p>A number is written in <strong>scientific notation</strong> if it is written in the form \(a xx 10^n\),</p>
<p>where\(1&lt;\) \(|n|\)\(&lt;10\) and <em>n</em> is an integer.</p>
< 
<ul>
<li>If you move the decimal point to the left, as with a large number, then <em>n</em> is positive.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, consider the number 2,780,418. This is a whole number so the decimal point is understood to be to the right of the digit in the ones column. We need to move this decimal point between the 2 and the 7.</p>
<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip1-1686780700560.png"/></p>
<p>We moved the decimal point 6 places to the left, so the exponent on base 10 is positive 6. The exponent is positive because the original number was greater than 1.</p>
<p>\(2,780,418 = 2.780418 xx 10^6\)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you move the decimal point to the right, as with a small number, then <em>n</em> is negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take, for example, the radius of an electron, 0.00000000000047 m. Perform the same series of steps as above, except move the decimal point to the right. Be careful to <em>not</em> include the leading 0 in your count.</p>
<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip0-1686781048978.png"/></p>
<p>We move the decimal point 13 places to the right, so the exponent of 10 is -13. The exponent is negative because the value of the original number is less than 1.</p>
<p>\(0.00000000000047=4.7xx10^-13\)</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p><strong>Write each number in scientific notation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Distance to Andromeda Galaxy from Earth: 24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 m</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 22 places to the left, (between the 2 and 4) in order to have a number between 1 and 10. The exponent on base 10 will be positive because the given distance is greater than 1.</p>
<p>\(24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 2.4 xx10^22\)</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Average distance between Earth and the Sun: 92,960,000 m</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 7 places to the left, (between the 9 and 2) in order to have a number between 1 and 10. The exponent on base 10 will be positive because the given distance is greater than 1.</p>
<p>\(92,960,000 = 9.296 xx10^7\)</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>One picometer is approximately 0.00000000003397 inches</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 11 places to the right, (between the 3's) in order to have a number between 1 and 10. The exponent on base 10 will be negative because the given length is less than 1.</p>
<p>\(0.00000000003397 = 3.397 xx10^-11\)</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Probability of being struck by lightning in any single year: 0.00000143</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 6 places to the left, (between the 1 and 4) in order to have a number between 1 and 10. The exponent on base 10 will be negative because the given distance is greater than 1.</p>
<p>\(0.00000143 =1.4 3xx10^-6\)</p>
<h5> </h5>
<h5>Write each number in standard decimal notation.</h5>
<p><strong>5. </strong>One light year is approximately \(5.88 xx 10^12\) miles.</p>
<p>We move the decimal point 12 places to the right as indicated by a positive exponent.</p>
<p>\(5.88 xx 10^12=5,880,000,000,000\)</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>The mass of a particle of dust is about \(7.53 xx 10^-10\) kg.</p>
<p>\(7.53xx10^-10=0.000000000753\)</p>
