<p>Now that we know how to apply an inverse process in order to solve a multi-step equation in which the variable occurs just once, it's time to consider equations with more than one variable.</p>

<p>These equations are known as literal equations. When a literal equation is applicable in a particular situation, it is typically called a formula.</p>

<p>For example, we can calculate the distance traveled if we know the rate of travel and the time spent traveling:</p>
\[ "distance" = ("rate")("time") \]
<p>This can be written more efficiently as the literal equation (or formula)</p>
\[ d = rt \]

<p>It is often necessary, or at least desirable, to solve a literal equation for a particular variable.</p>

<p>In this section, we will focus on solving literal equations for a variable that only occurs once - which is good news, because it means that we already know all of the strategies & rules that are needed.</p>

<p>The main difficulty will be in keeping our expressions neat and organized, because - unlike equations with a single variable and a bunch of constants - the solution for a literal equation is a mathematical expression that can't be simplified down to a single number or symbol.</p>

<p>Consider the equation</p>
\[ -7x + 11 = -3 \]
<p>First, we subtract \( 11\) from both sides to get</p>
\[ -7x = -14 \]
<p>Next, we divide both sides by \( -7\) to get our solution:</p>
\[ x = 2 \]
<p>Each step of solving involved operations performed with constants, so the final solution was a single constant.</p>

<p>Now suppose we are trying to solve</p>
\[ ax + b = c \]
<p>First of all, there are multiple variables in this equation, so we need to specify which variable we're solving for. Let's solve it for \( x\).</p>
<p>First, we'll subtract \( b\) from both sides to get</p>
\[ ax = c-b \]
<p>Notice that since \( c\) and \( b\) are different variables, we can't combine them into a single term.</p>
<p>Next, we divide both sides by \( a\) (and at this point we have to assume that \( a \neq 0\) ) to get our solution:</p>
\[ x = (c-b)/a \]
<p>We cannot simplify this solution, because \( c\), \( b\), and \( a\) are different variables, and cannot be combined.</p>
<p>If we want to, we can write an equivalent expression \( (c - b)/a - &gt; c/a - b/a\), but that's about all we can do with our solution.</p>

<p>Notice that both of the equations above were solved using the same process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Subtract something from both sides of the equation</li>
  <li>Divide both sides of the equation by something</li>
</ol>
<p>However, because the second equation had multiple variables, the solution looked a lot more complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>(a) Solve for \( n\): \( 3n-5=7t\)<br />
(b) Solve for \( W\): \( P = 2L + 2W\)</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<p>(a) \( 3n-5 = 7t\)<br />
\( 3n - 5\)<br />
\( ul(" "+5)\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( 7t\)<br />
\( ul(+5)\)<br />
Add 5 to both sides.<br />
\( 3n\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( 7t+5\)<br />
Divide both sides by 3.<br />
\( n\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( (7t+5)/3\)</p>

<p>(b) \( P = 2L + 2W\)<br />
\( P\)<br />
\( ul(" "-2L)\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( 2L + 2W\)<br />
\( ul(-2L)\)<br />
Subtract \( 2L\) from both sides.<br />
\( P - 2L\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( 2W\)<br />
Divide both sides by 2.<br />
\( (P-2L)/2\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( (2W)/2\)<br />
Divide both sides by 2.<br />
\( (P-2L)/2\)<br />
\( =\)<br />
\( W\)<br />
If desired, we could write the solution with an equivalent expression: \( W = P/2 - (2L)/2\).<br />
After simplifying the last fraction, this becomes \( W = P/2 - L\)</p>

<p><strong>Solving for \( y\)</strong></p>

<p>Later on in this course, we will be learning about graphing equations. Those equations will typically contain the variables \( x\) and \( y\).<br />
It is frequently very desirable to have these equations solved for \( y\). In many cases, an equation solved for \( y\) is easier to graph by hand.<br />
Also - it is necessary to have an equation solved for \( y\) when entering it into a graphing calculator.</p>
