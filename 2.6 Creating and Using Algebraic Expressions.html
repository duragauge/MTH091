<h3>Evaluating Algebraic Expressions with the Order of Operations</h3>
<p>To evaluate an expression is to determine the value of the expression when specific values have been used for each variable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example 1</strong>. Evaluate the expression \(x+y-5\) for the values\(x=2\) and\(y=-3.\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">\(x+y-5\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(=2+(-3)-5\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(=2-3-5\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(=-1-5\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(=-6\)</p>
<p>Oftentimes expressions will involve multiple operations. For example, say we had the expression \(5x-3\) , when we try to evaluate this for\(x=2\) we get\(5*2-3\) . This involves two operations: multiplication and subtraction. Which one do we do first? Multiply\(2*5\) or subtract \(2-3? \) We dp get different results if we do one or the other first. Fortunately, mathematics has adopted a standard order of operations to tell us which to do first. When dealing with multiple operations in an expression, we have to use the established order of operations.</p>

<p><strong>Order of Operations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Perform any operations within <strong>groupings</strong>. Groupings are typically shown within parentheses or brackets. Less commonly, groupings will involve an operation in an exponent or in the numerator (top) / denominator (bottom) of a fraction.</li>
<li>Apply any <strong>exponents</strong>.</li>
<li>Apply any <strong>multiplication</strong> or <strong>division</strong> operations from left to right.</li>
<li>Apply any <strong>addition</strong> or <strong>subtraction</strong> operations from left to right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people use the acronym GEMDAS to help them remember the order of operations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>G</strong> = groupings<br /><strong>E</strong> = exponents<br /><strong>MD</strong> = multiplication or division (done together from left to right)<br /><strong>AS</strong> = addition or subtraction (done together from left to right)</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example 2.</strong>Carefully evaluate each expression using the order of operations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">Evaluate \(7(x-2)\) for\(x=5\) .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(7(5-2)\)   Plug in 5 for <em>x.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 160px;">\(=7(3)\) The \(5-2\) was grouped togehter with the parentheses. We evaluated it first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 160px;">\(=21\)    We finish with the multiplication.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">Evaluate \(7-5x^2\) for\(x=3\) .</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(7-5*3^2\)       Plug in 3 for <em>x</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 160px;">\(=7-5*9\)  There were no groupings in this expression. So we evaluated the exponent of 2 on the base of 3 first.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 160px;">\(=7-45\)   Multiplication of \(5*9\) would be done before subtraction</p>
<p style="padding-left: 160px;">\(=38\)      We finish with subtraction.</p>
<h3>Creating and Using Algebraic Expressions</h3>
<p>Algebraic expressions can be created as recipes, formulas, or instructions for how to calculate a specific result.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example 3. </strong>The cost to hire a repair technician from a certain involves a $65 call-out fee on top or a labor charge of $85 per hour. Write an expression that would give the total cost to hire a repair technician for<em>x</em> hours. Use your expression to calculate the cost for the technician for 1, 3 and 5 hours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">The cost of hiring this repair technician for <em>x</em> hours would be calculated with the expression: \(85x+65.\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">The cost to hire the technician for 1 hour would be \(85*1+65 = 85+65 = $150\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">The cost to hire the technician for 3 hours would be\(85*3+65=255+65=$320\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">The cost to hire the technician for 5 hours would be\(85*5+65=425+65=$470\)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example 4.</strong>An employee earns $18 per hour. They get paid every two weeks. They already worked 27 hours last week. Write an expression for what their pay will be for this two-week period if they work <em>x</em> hours this week. Use your expression to calculate the employee's pay if they work 30 hours this week.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">There are two different expressions that could make sense to use here:\(18(27+x)\) or\(18*27+18x\) . You may notice that the distributive property could be used to turn the first expression into the second one, so they are equivalent to each other.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">If the employee worked 30 hours this week, we would calculate their pay as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">\(18(27+30)=18(57)=$1026\)  or  \(18*27+18*30=486 + 540=$1026\)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Looking ahead to the next chapter.</h3>
<p>Our next chapter focuses on solving equations. Thinking about our previous example, it is easy to see where the need to solve an equation comes from. Imagine that the employee wanted to earn at least $750 for the two-week pay period. We know that they can calculate their pay with this expression\(18(27+x)\) where <em>x</em> represents the hours the employee works in the second week. So their question is what would they need to plug in for <em>x</em> to have this expression result in a value of $750? That is, they want to<strong>solve</strong> the<strong>equation</strong>\(18(27+x)=750\) . If you are curious, the answer is about 14.7 hours.</p>
