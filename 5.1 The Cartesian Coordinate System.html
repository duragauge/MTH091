<h1>5.1 The Cartesian Coordinate System</h1>
<h3>A Quick History of the Cartesian Coordinate System</h3>
<p>According to stories, the French Mathematician Rene Descartes (famous for penning the phrase, "I think therefore I am") invented the modern way of graphing in the 1600s. The cartesian coordinate system that we will explore in this section gets its name from Rene Descartes' last name).</p>
<p>According to the story, while laying in his bed, Descartes was watching a bug crawling around on his ceiling. It occurred to him that he could describe the location of the bug by describing how far it was from each of the two walls forming one of the corners of the ceiling.</p>

<p>We call this graphing grid a cartesian coordinate system or a coordinate plane. A cartesian coordinate system or coordinate plane involves two number lines, each serving as an axis for the coordinate system.</p>
<p>The horizontal axis is typically referred to as the x-axis. The vertical axis is typically referred to as the y-axis.</p>
<p>The point where the two axes meet is called the origin. The two axes together divide the plane into 4 rectangular quarters. We call these the 4 quadrants and refer to them as quadrant I, II, III, and IV.</p>

<h3>Graphing Ordered Pairs</h3>
<p>To graph on a cartesian coordinate system, we need values for two coordinates: an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. The x-coordinate tells us a location along the x-axis. The y-coordinate tells us a location along the y-axis. Together, those two coordinates tell us a specific location in the plane.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/34769/desmos-graph_2.png" alt="point with x-coordinate of 2 and y-coordinate of 3 is graphed" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>The point graphed above has an x-coordinate of 2 and a y-coordinate of 3. We refer to the location of this point with the ordered pair (2,3). With an ordered pair, we always list the x-coordinate first and the y-coordinate second.</p>
<p>Ordered Pairs</p>
<p>An ordered pair refers to the location of a point in a Cartesian Coordinate System by describing both the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate in the form: (x-coordinate, y-coordinate).</p>
<p>Example: Use an ordered pair to describe the location of each point labeled in the graph below.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/34769/desmos-graph_3.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>A is the point (1,3). This point is in quadrant I.</p>
<p>B is the point (4,2). This point is in quadrant I.</p>
<p>C is the point (-3,-5). This point is in quadrant III.</p>
<p>D is the point (-5,5). This point is in quadrant II.</p>
<p>E is the point (3,-5). This point is in quadrant IV.</p>
<p>F is the point (-3,0). This point is on the x-axis.</p>
<p>G is the point (0,0). This point is on the origin.</p>
<p>One of the most common mistakes people make with ordered pairs is to list the coordinates in reverse order. So always remember, an ordered pair has the form (x-coordinate, y-coordinate).</p>
<p>To plot a point given its ordered pair, locate each coordinate on its axis and find the point that shares both coordinates.</p>
<p>For example, the animation below illustrates plotting the point (5,4).</p>
 
<p>Plotting ordered pairs like this can be very useful to help visualize concepts and relationships.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p>As part of a research study, a new parent was asked to weigh their newborn baby every month for 12 months to track its development. The weights are recorded in the table below.</p>
<p>Age (months)</p>
<p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Weight (pounds) 7.5 9.75 12.25 14 15.5 16.5 17.5 18.25 19 19.5 20.25 20.75 21.25</p>
<p>We can treat all of these age/weight pairs as ordered pairs and graph them to visualize the baby's growth over the year. We will use the baby's age as our x-coordinate and its weight as our y-coordinate.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/34769/desmos-graph_4.png" alt="Baby age vs. weight graph" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>By graphing these points, we can visualize that the baby grew much faster in the first 6 months than it did in the second six months. Graphs are incredibly useful for understanding numerical information we encounter.</p>
<h3>Graphing Equations</h3>
<p>In addition to graphing specific points like we saw above, graphing can give us a fantastic way to visualize equations and relationships between variables!</p>
<p>Let's start with an example. Here in the United States, we tend to be familiar with the Fahrenheit scale for measuring temperature. In most of the rest of the world, it is more common to see temperature measured in Celsius. As a result, when a US native travels abroad, understanding temperature forecasts can be a challenge. The equation\(F=1.8C+32\) can be used to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit. We are going to do a couple of things with this equation.</p>
<p>First, let's just use it a few times.</p>
<p>If the temperature forecast calls for 15 degrees Celsius, we could determine the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit by using the given formula.</p>
<p>\(F=1.8 \cdot 15+32\)</p>
<p>\(F=27+32\)</p>
<p>\(F=59\)</p>
<p>A temperature of 15 degrees Celsius is equivalent to a temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are headed outside, you might want a light jacket.</p>
 
<p>What if the temperature was forecast to be -10 degrees Celsius?</p>
<p>\(F=1.8 \cdot (-10)+32\)</p>
<p>\(F=-18+32\)</p>
<p>\(F=14\)</p>
<p>A temperature of -10 degrees Celsius is equivalent to a temperature of 14 degrees Fahrenheit. You better be prepared for subfreezing conditions!</p>
 
Let's make a table of values for this equation to showing even more Celsius / Fahrenheit pairs. We'll put the two we just determined in the table, and we can use the equation several more times to fill out the entire table.</p>

<p>With this table, we can now graph the ordered pairs to visualize the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Since we only plotted some of the potential Fahrenheit/Celsius pairs (there are other we could have put in the table and could have graphed), we should connect the dots with a line to show all the possible Fahrenheit/Celsius pairs.</p>

<p>We plot the points and draw a curve connecting them. This u-shaped graph is called a <strong>parabola</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/34769/desmos-graph_42.png" alt="Graph of a quadratic" width="368" height="368" /></p>
<p>Do you notice the point at the bottom of the parabola, were it changes direction? For this parabola that point appears to be (3, -7). That point is called the <strong>vertex of the parabola.</strong> Identifying the vertex when you are graphing a parabola can be helpful since we know that graph will be two mirror image halves on either side of the vertex.</p>
