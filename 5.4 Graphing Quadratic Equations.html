<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When farmers plant an orchard, they're concerned about how to achieve the largest possible harvest. They don't want to plant too few trees—that's obvious—but they also don't want to plant too many, because overcrowded trees don't produce as much. So how do they determine the right number to maximize the harvest?</p>

<p>Questions like this, where optimizing results is important, are often modeled by quadratic equations, and the coordinates of the vertex often hold the answers we are looking for.</p>


<h3>Parts of a Parabola</h3>
<p>In an earlier chapter (sections 4.2 and 4.3) we learned that \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) is the standard form for a quadratic equation and earlier in this chapter (section 5.1) we saw that graphs of quadratic equations are parabolas.</p>

<p>There are several key features of the graph of a parabola. Like any graph, the \(y\)-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the \(y\)-axis, and any place it comes in contact with the \(x\)-axis is an \(x\)-intercept. A parabola may have as many as \(2\) \(x\)-intercepts or none at all.</p>

<p>The place where the parabola turns is the <strong>vertex</strong>.  This might be a maximum or a minimum, depending on the direction of the graph.</p>

<p>An imaginary vertical line drawn through the vertex is called the <strong>axis of symmetry</strong> and it divides the parabola into two symmetric halves, making it easier to sketch the graph.</p>

<p>All of those features are labeled in the image below.</p>

<p style="margin:1.2em;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duragauge/MTH091/aea094ccfae3d763852803ac94d0bb21e73288a2/images/parabola_parts.svg" alt="" width="400"/></p>

<p>In contrast to the straightforward slope-intercept form of a line, determining the exact location of most features of a parabola from its equation \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) can be challenging.  There is one feature, however, that we can quicky spot. The constant value \(c\) is always the \(y\)-intercept.</p>

<p>The \(x\)-intercepts are solutions to the equation \(0=ax^2+bx+c\) and can be found either by factoring or by using the quadratic formula.</p>

<p>Each coordinate of the vertex is found separately.  To get the \(x\)-coordinate we use the formula \(x_v=\frac{-b}{2a}\).  Once we have that value, we substitute it back into the quadratic equation to get the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex: \(y_v=a(x_v)^2+b(x_v)+c\).</p>



========================

overcrowded trees will yield a lower harvest compared to trees with an optimal amount of space

But it's not as simple as just planting more trees. </p>

<p>When farmers plant an orchard one thing on their mind is maximizing the overall yield of their harvest. Doing so requires balancing two competing factors: increasing the number of trees and giving each tree enough room to grow and mature.</p>

<p>Situations like this, and many others where optimizing results is important, are often modeled by quadratic equations, with the coordinates of the vertex holding the sought after solution.</p>


or trees per acre and giving each plant First, You might assume simply increasing the number of plants or trees on an acre would increase the harvest, but that's not the case.  If plants are too close together they won't grow to their potential. But if they give plants as much room as they want, they you might not

Oregon produces 99% of all hazelnuts in the United States and, likewise, the hazelnut is Oregon's state nut. Specifically, the Willamette Valley to the south of Portland provides the ideal moderate climate for the trees to flourish. This special corner of the world is where river, mountain, and ocean climates combine with rich volcanic soils to produce the right conditions for a large hazelnut crop production. Currently about 1000 Oregon farms grow hazelnuts on 87,000 acres.

Imagine you're in charge of designing a fireworks display for a grand celebration. To create a dazzling spectacle, you need to carefully calculate the paths of the fireworks as they burst into the night sky. The fireworks shoot up in the air, explode, and create a beautiful display of lights. But how can you predict the height they'll reach, the time they'll take to reach their peak, and where they'll fall back to the ground?
