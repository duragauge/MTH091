        <h1>5.1 The Cartesian Coordinate System</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Legend has it that Ren√© Descartes, the 17th-century French mathematician and philosopher renowned for coining the phrase "I think, therefore I am," once lay in bed observing a bug's journey across his ceiling. In a moment of inspiration, he realized he could pinpoint the insect's location by defining its distance from the two adjoining walls that formed a corner on the ceiling.</p>

<p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/42u4djawnr?embed" width="350" height="300" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe></p>

<p>This spark of ingenuity forever transformed the way we visualize mathematics.</p>


<h3>The Cartesian Plane</h3>
<p>The coordinate system that came from Descartes' work is now called the Cartesian coordinate system or the Cartesian coordinate plane.</p>

<p>This system is formed by two perpendicular number lines, each one called an <strong>axis</strong>.  The horizontal axis is often referred to as the \(x\)-axis and the vertical axis is known as the \(y\)-axis.</p>

<p>The point where the two axes meet is called the <strong>origin</strong>.  The origin serves as the fixed point of reference for all other points on the coordinate plane.</p>

<p>The point where the two axes meet is called the origin. The two axes together divide the plane into 4 rectangular quarters. We call these quadrants and refer to them as quadrant I, II, III, and IV.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/desmos-graph_1.png" alt="Cartesian Coordinate System with x-axis, y-axis, origin and quadrants labeled." width="300" height="300" /></p>


<h3>Cartesian Coordinates</h3>
<p>Graphing on the Cartesian plane hinges on knowing two values: one for the \(x\)-axis and another for the \(y\)-axis. Together, these two coordinates identify a unique point on the plane.</p>

<p>The coordinates of a point are always written as an ordered \((x, y)\) pair, with the \(x\)-coordinate first and the \(y\)-coordinate second. So a pair of numbers like \((2, 3)\) would represent the point that has an \(x\)-coordinate of \(2\) and a \(y\)-coordinate of \(3\).<p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/desmos-graph_2.png" alt="point with x-coordinate of 2 and y-coordinate of 3 is graphed" width="300" height="300" /></p>

<div style="min-width:600px;width:100%;margin-top:1.2em;margin-bottom:1.2em; background:#f0f8ff; border-radius:15px; border:2px solid #0066ff;  padding:5px 10px 10px 10px;">
    <strong>Example 1</strong>
    <p>Use an ordered pair to give the coordinates of each point labeled in this graph.  Also identify the quadrant the point is in.</p>
    <img src="images/desmos-graph_3.png" alt="find the coordinates of a plotted point" style="display: block; width: 260px; margin: 1.2em;"> 
    <hr>
    <strong>Solution:</strong>
    <p>A is the point \((1,3)\). This point is in quadrant I.</p>
    <p>B is the point \((4,2)\). This point is in quadrant I.</p>
    <p>C is the point \((-3,-5)\). This point is in quadrant III.</p>
    <p>D is the point \((-5,5)\). This point is in quadrant II.</p>
    <p>E is the point \((3,-5)\). This point is in quadrant IV.</p>
    <p>F is the point \((-3,0)\). This point is on the x-axis.</p>
    <p>G is the point \((0,0)\). This point is on the origin.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most common mistakes people make with ordered pairs is to list the coordinates in reverse order. So always remember, an ordered pair has the form \((x, y)\).</p>


<h3>Plotting Points</h3>
<p>The key to ploting points on the Cartesian plane is remembering that coordinates are an ordered \((x, y)\) pair.  

<p>To plot the point \((5, 4)\), for instance, find \(5\) on the \(x\)-axis and draw an imaginary vertical line through it.  Then find \(4\) on the \(y\)-axis and sketch an imaginary horizontal line through it.  The point \((5, 4)\) is located at the spot where those two lines cross. The animation below illustrates this process.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/k9kbuwo6rk?embed" width="400" height="400" frameborder="0" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe></p>
 

<h3>Scatterplots</h3>
<p>Plotting ordered pairs can be very helpful in visualizing concepts and relationships.  This is especially true when the information is given as a table of values.</p> 

<p>By viewing each pair of data in the table as an ordered pair, we can convert the table into plotted points, creating what is known as a <strong>scatterplot</strong>. The shape of the scatterplot can suggest patterns that are difficult to see from the numerical data alone.</p>

<div style="min-width:600px;width:100%;margin-top:1.2em;margin-bottom:1.2em; background:#f0f8ff; border-radius:15px; border:2px solid #0066ff;  padding:5px 10px 10px 10px;overflow:auto;">
    <strong>Example 2</strong>
    <p>As part of a research study, a newborn baby was weighed every month for 12 months to track its development. The weights are recorded in the table below.</p>
    <table style="width:100%;" border="1">
        <tr>
            <td><b>Age (months)</b></td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Weight (pounds)</b></td><td>7.5</td><td>9.75</td><td>12.25</td><td>14</td><td>15.5</td><td>16.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>18.25</td><td>19</td><td>19.5</td><td>20.25</td><td>20.75</td><td>21.25</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Create a scatterplot of the data and describe any patterns you see.</p>
    <hr>
    <strong>Solution</strong>
    <p>We will view each age/weight pairs as ordered pairs, using age as the \(x\)-coordinate and weight as the \(y\)-coordinate.</p>
    <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/desmos-graph_4.png" alt="Baby age vs. weight graph" width="300" height="300" /></p>
    <p>By graphing these points, we can quickly see visually that the baby's weight increased faster in the first 6 months than it did in the second six months.</p>
</div>


<h3>Graphing Linear Equations</h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter an equation of any type a process similar to the one we used above can be empolyed to produce a graph of that equation. The only difference is the values in the table will need to be calculated using the equation.<p>

<p>This is done by putting random values into the equation for the \(x\)-variable and evaluating the equation to get the corresponding \(y\)-value.  The points are then plotted and a smooth line or curve is drawn through them to indicate the other values we did not compute.</p>

<p>As an example, let's consider the linear equation \(F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32\) which we saw in section 3.3.  This formula converts temperature in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, something that would be helpful for a US native traveling abroad.<p>

<p>If the temperature forecast was for \(15\) degrees Celsius, then the formula gives the corresponding temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

\begin{align}
    F &= \frac{9}{5} \cdot 15+32 \\
    &=27+32 \\
    &= 59
\end{align}

<p>This means that a temperature of \(15\) degrees Celsius is equivalent to \(59\) degrees Fahrenheit. If you were headed outside, you might want to take a light jacket.</p>
 
<p>In the table below we've computed several more Celsius/Fahrenheit temperatures.</p>

<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;">
    <tbody>
        <tr style="height: 18px;">
            <td>Celsius</td>
            <td>-10</td>
            <td>-5</td>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>25</td>
            <td>30</td>
            <td>35</td>
            <td>40</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="height: 18px;">
            <td>Fahrenheit</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>23</td>
            <td>32</td>
            <td>41</td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td>59</td>
            <td>68</td>
            <td>77</td>
            <td>86</td>
            <td>95</td>
            <td>104</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>With this table, we can now graph the ordered pairs to visualize the relationship between Celsius and Fahrenheit.</p>

<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/temperature_scatterplot.svg" alt="Celsius and Fahrenheit Grap" width="280" height="280" /></p>

<p>Since we only plotted some of the potential Celsius/Fahrenheit pairs (there are other we could have computed), we'll connect the dots with a line to show all the possible pairs.</p>

<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/temperature_line.svg" alt="Line Graph of Celsius vs. Fahrenheit" width="280" height="280" /></p>

<p>Any equation like this one, which produces the graph of a line, is called a <strong>linear equation</strong>. Linear equations do not have any powers or roots on the variables. We will work with linear equations more in the next two sections.</p>


 <h3>Graphing Nonlinear Equations</h3>
<p>Not every equation that we encounter will result in the graph of a line.  Some might have some type of curve to them, like the graph from the baby data.</p>

<p>We will finish this section with an example of a nonlinear equation: \(y=x^2-6x-2\).  We can identify this as being nonlinear because there is a power on the \(x\).</p>

<p>Even though the equation is more complicated the the prior example, we will follow the same steps, starting with calculating values, the plotting the points, and finally drawing a smooth curve between them.</p>

<p>With linear equations, a good graph can be draw with just a few points.  With nonlinear graphs, it is good practice to plot several points.</p>

<table border="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th style="padding: 10px;">\[x\]</th>
            <th style="padding: 10px;">\[y\]</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[-1\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(-1)^2-6(-1)+2=9\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[0\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(0)^2-6(0)+2=2\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[1\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(1)^2-6(1)+2=-3\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[2\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(2)^2-6(2)+2=-6\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[3\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(3)^2-6(3)+2=-7\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[4\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(4)^2-6(4)+2=-6\]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[5\]</td>
            <td style="padding: 10px;">\[(5)^2-6(5)+2=-3\]</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Plotting the points and connecting them with a smooth curve gives the U-shaped graph below.</p>

<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/desmos-graph_42.png" alt="Graph of a quadratic" width="368" height="368" /></p>

<p>This shape is called a <strong>parabola</strong> and comes from a quadratic equation-one that has an \(x^2\) in it.  We will look into the graphs of quadratic equations toward the end of this chapter.</p>

<p>A defining feature of every parabola is that it can be split into two mirror image halves.  If you locate the point where the graph turns around, in this case \((3, -7)\), then a vertical line through that point will split the two halves.  That point is called the <strong>vertex of the parabola.</strong>  Identifying the vertex when you are graphing a parabola can be helpful since once you've drawn one half you can simply make a mirror copy for the other half.</p>
 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In this section, we explored the Cartesian coordinate system, plotting ordered pairs, and visualizing the relationships between variables through scatterplots. We learned how linear equations result in straight-line graphs, while nonlinear equations can give rise to intriguing curves like parabolas.</p>

<p>As we move forward into the next section we will consider the concept of <strong>slope</strong>, which plays a pivotal role in understanding the steepness and direction of lines.</p>
