<p><strong>Absolute Value: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Algebra: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Algebraic Expression: </strong> A combination of variables and/or constants using mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic Equation: </strong> A statement uses the equal sign \(=\) to show that two expressions or quantities are equal to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Base: </strong> A quantity that has an exponent.  See <strong>Power</strong> for an example.</p>

<p><strong>Axis: </strong> The horizontal and vertical reference lines on a coordinate plane.</p>

<p><strong>Cartesian Coordinates: </strong> A way of communicating the location of a point by referencing its position relative to two perpendicular axis.  The coordinates are written as an \(x,y\) ordered pair.</p>

<p><strong>Cartesian Plane: </strong> A graphing grid containing two perpendicular axis, typically the \(x\)-axis is horiztontal and the \(y\)-axis is vertical.</p>

<p><strong>Coefficient: </strong> A constant that multiplies a varaible.  In the expression \(7x^3\), the coefficient is \(7\).</p>

<p><strong>Constant: </strong>A quantity whose value does not change.</p>

<p><strong>Denominator: </strong> The bottom part of a fraction or rational expression.</p>

<p><strong>Divisor: </strong> A number that divides another number.</p>

<p><strong>Equation: </strong> See <strong>Algebraic Equation</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Exponent: </strong> A small number written in the upper right of a quantity to indicate how many times it should be multiplied by iteslf.  See also <strong>Power</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Expression: </strong> See <strong>Algebraic Expression</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Factor: </strong> When quantites are multiplied together, each one is called a factor.  </p>

<p><strong>Factoring: </strong> The process of determining the factors which, when multiplied together, give the original quantity.  Also called <strong>Factorization</strong>.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Inequality: </strong> A relationship showing that one quantity is greater than or less than another using the symbols \(\gt\) or \(\lt\).</p>

<p><strong>Integers: </strong> Positive and negative natural numbers, including \(0\).</p>

<p><strong>Intercept: </strong> The point(s) where a graph crosses the axis of a coordinate plane.  An \(x\)-intercept is where it crosses the \(x\)-axis.  Likewise, a \(y\)-intercept is where it crosses the \(y\)-axis.</p>

<p><strong>Intersection: </strong> The point(s) where two graphs cross.</p>

<p><strong>Irrational Numbers: </strong> Numbers whose decimal expansion goes on forever with no repeating pattern.  These cannot be written as a ratio of integers.  Examples include \(\pi\) and \(\sqrt{2}\\).</p>

<p><strong>Like Terms: </strong> Terms that have the same variables raised to identical powers.  For instance, \(5x^3\) and \(-8x^3\) are like terms because both have the variable \(x\) raised to a power of \(3\).</p>

<p><strong>Linear Equation: </strong> Any equation whose graph is a line.  The variables in a linear equation do not have any exponents higher than \(1\) and are not in the denominator of a fraction.  For instance, \(y=2x-7\) and \(3x+6y=12\) are both linear equations.</p>

<p><strong>Monomial: </strong></p> A 

<p><strong>Natural Numbers: </strong> The numbers we normally count with, ie. \(1, 2, 3, \dots\).  Very similar to the <strong>whole numbers</strong>, except \(0\) is not a natural number.</p>

<p><strong>Number Line: </strong> A horizontal line that is a visual representation of all real numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Numerator: </strong> The top of a fraction or rational expression.</p>

<p><strong>Operation: </strong> A way of combining two numbers to create a new value.  Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are examples of operations, though there are many more.</p>

<p><strong>Order of Operations: </strong> The </p>

<p><strong>Ordered Pair: </strong> See <strong>Cartesian Coordinates</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Origin: </strong> On a Cartesian plane, the origin is the point where the two perpendicular axis meet.  It has coordinates of \(0, 0\).</p>

<p><strong>Polynomial: </strong> An expression that only involves addition, subtraction, and multiplication of variables and constants.  The variables in a polynomial will only have whole number exponents.  For example, \(-2x^3 + 4x^2 - x + 5\) is a polynomial.</p>

<p><strong>Power: </strong> A quantity being multiplied by itself a specific number of times. The power is written as a small superscript (the <strong>Exponent</strong>) on the top right corner of the quantity being multiplied (the <strong>Base</strong>). For instance, \(x^3\), the base \(x\) is has an exponent of \(3\), and this is the third power of \(x\).  Frequently called an <strong>Exponent</strong> and sometimes an <strong>Index</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Quadratic Equation: </strong> An equation where the highest power is \(2\).  The standard way to write a quadratic equation is \(y=ax^2+bx+c\).</p>

<p><strong>Quadratic Formula: </strong></p> A formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.  If \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), then the two solutions are given by \(x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\).

<p><strong>Rational Expression: </strong> A fraction involving algebraic expressions.</p>

<p><strong>Rational Numbers: </strong> All numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers.  These are fractions.</p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Real Numbers: </strong> All numbers that can be written as a decimal.  This includes natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational, and irrational numbers.  It does not include square roots of negative numbers, which are imaginary numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Root: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Slope-Intercept Form: </strong> A linear equation written in the format \(y=mx+b\) where \(m\) is the slope and \((0,b)\) is the \(y\)-intercept.</p>

<p><strong>Term: </strong> Part of an algebraic expression that might be added or subtracted with other parts.  In the expression \(4x+9\), both \(4x\) and \(8\) are terms.</p>

<p><strong>Variable: </strong> A quantity whose value can change, usually represented by a letter such as \(x\) or \(y\).</p>

<p><strong>Whole Numbers:</strong> The natural numbers along with \(0\). </p>
