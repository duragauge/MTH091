<h1>2.4 Exponents</h1>
<h3>A. Definition of an Exponent</h3>
<p>We use exponents as a kind of shorthand for repeated addition. If we multiply the number 5 times itself 6 times, we can write,</p>
<p>\(5*5*5*5*5*5\)</p>
<p>but it is much shorter to write \(5^6\).</p>
<p>In this example, we call 5 the <strong>base</strong> and 6 the <strong>exponent</strong>. When written as \(5^6\), the meaning is that 5 is a factor 6 times. We call \(5^6\)a <strong>power</strong> of 5, namely the 6<sup>th</sup> power of 5.</p>
<p>In general, for any natural number <em>n</em>, the notation \(b^n\)indicates that <em>b</em> is a factor <em>n</em> times.</p>
<h5>Definition of an Exponent</h5>
<p>For any natural number <em>n</em>,<em>b<sup>n</sup></em>=<em>b</em><em>\(*\)</em><em>b\(*\) b\(*\) b ... </em>where <em>b</em> is a factor <em>n</em> times.</p>
<p>We refer to <em>b<sup>n </sup></em>as “<em>b</em> raised to the <em>n</em>th power.” We call <em>b</em> the <strong>base</strong> and <em>n</em> the <strong>exponent</strong>.</p>
 
<p>For most powers of a base, we will use our calculators to find the value. For the example, type the base 5 and then use the exponent button ^ before typing 6. We see that5<sup>6</sup> = 15625.</p>
 
<p>Notice <em>b</em><sup>1 </sup>that stands for one factor of <em>b</em>, so <em>b</em><sup>1</sup> = <em>b.</em>We typically do not write the exponent in this case. Two other powers have specific names. We refer to <em>b</em><sup>2 </sup>as “<em>b </em>squared” and <em>b</em><sup>3 </sup>as “<em>b</em> cubed.” These nicknames come from geometry formulas for the area of a square and the volume of a cube.</p>
<h3>B. Properties of Exponents</h3>
<h3>The Product Property of Exponents</h3>
<p>Consider the product\(b^3*b^4\) . Both terms have the same base, <em>b</em>, but they are raised to different exponents. We expand each expression, and then rewrite the resulting expression with an exponent.</p>
<p>\(b^3*b^4=(b*b*b)(b*b*b*b)=b^7\)</p>
<p>The result is that \(b^3*b^4\) equals \(b^(3+4)\), which equals \(b^7\).</p>
<p>Notice that the exponent of the product is the sum of the exponents of the terms. In other words, when multiplying exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and add the exponents. This is the product property of exponents and is stated in general terms below.</p>
<p><strong>The Product Property of Exponents</strong></p>
<p>For two exponential terms with the same base, their product is:</p>
<p>\(b^m*b^n=b^(m+n)\)</p>
<h3>The Quotient Property of Exponents</h3>
<p>In a similar way to the product property, we can simplify an expression such as \(b^m/b^n\), where <em>m</em> &gt; <em>n</em>. Consider the example \(b^7/b^4\). Perform the division by canceling common factors.</p>
\(b^7/b^4\)
<p>=</p>
<p>\((b*b*b*b*b*b*b)/(b*b*b*b)\)</p>
<p>Definition of exponent.</p>
<p>\(b^7/b^4\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(1*1*1*1*b*b*b\)
<p>Divide:\(b/b=1\)</p>
<p>\(b^7/b^4\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(b^3\)
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>Notice that the exponent of the quotient is the difference between the exponents of the divisor and dividend. So the shortcut would look like this:\(b^7/b^4=b^(7-4)=b^3\)</p>
<p>In other words, when dividing exponential expressions with the same base, we write the result with the common base and subtract the exponents. This is the quotient property of exponents, it is stated in general terms below.</p>
<p><strong>The Quotient Property of Exponents</strong></p>
<p>For two exponential terms with the same base, their quotient is:</p>
<p>\(b^m/b^n=b^(m-n)\)</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify the following expressions.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> \(x^10/x^4=x^(10-4) = x^6\)</p>
 
<p><strong>2.</strong>\(a^13/a^11=a^(13-11)=a^2\)</p>
<h3>Raising a Product to a Power</h3>
<p>When a product of variables, or the product of real numbers and variables are in parentheses and raised to a power, then all the factors are raised to that power.</p>
<p><strong>Raising a Product to a Power</strong></p>
<p>\((ab)^n=a^n * b^n\)</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify the following expressions.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> \((2b)^4=2^4 * b^4=16b^4\)</p>
 
<p><strong>2.</strong>\((5x)^3=5^3*x^3=125x^3\)</p>
<h3>Raising a Quotient to a Power</h3>
<p>When a quotient of variables, or the quotient of real numbers and variables are in parentheses and raised to a power, then all the divisors and dividends are raised to that power.</p>
<p><strong>Raising a Quotient to a Power</strong></p>
<p>\((a/b)^n=a^n / b^n\)</p>
<h3><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
<p>Simplify the following expressions.</p>
<p><strong>1.\((2/b)^5=2^5/b^5=32/b^5\)</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>2.</strong>\(((3a)/4)^2=(3^2*a^2)/4^2=(9a^2)/16\)</p>
<h3>Raising a Power to a Power</h3>
<p>Let's explore raising an exponential term to another power. For example, let's raise\(b^3\) to the 4th power.</p>
<p>\((b^3)^4=b^3*b^3*b^3*b^3\) We expand to write\(b^3\) as a factor 4 times.</p>
<p>\( \) \(b^3*b^3*b^3*b^3=b^(3+3+3+3)=b^(3*4)=b^12\)</p>
<p>In the second step above, we see we can use the Product Property of Exponents to simplify. But the 'shortcut' is to multiply the exponents.</p>
<p>When a power or exponential term is raised to another power, the result can be found by multiplying the exponents.</p>
<p><strong>Raising a Product to a Power</strong></p>
<p>\((ab)^n=a^n * b^n\)</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Simplify the following expressions.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> \((b^2)^5=b^(2*5) = b^10\)</p>
 
<p><strong>2.</strong>\((x^4y^2)^3=(x^4)^3*(y^2)^3=x^12y^6\)</p>
