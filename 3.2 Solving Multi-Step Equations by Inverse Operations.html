<p>In the morning, before I go to school or work, as part of my work to get ready for the day, I put on my socks. Then I put on my shoes. At the end of the day, before I go to bed, I have to undo all of that. In order to uno that sequence of actions, we prefer the inverse actions (take off socks/shoes rather than put on socks/shoes), and we do those inverse actions in the reverse order of how the actions were originally done. We put on socks, then shoes. We take off shoes, then socks.</p>

<h3>An Example with a Context</h3>
<p>A repair technician charges $85 per hour for work along with a $65 "call out" fee. The expression\(85h+65\) can be used to calculate the total cost for a visit from the repair technician, where<em>h</em> is the number of hours that they work.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to calculate the cost for a 3 hour repair.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 66.7077%;" border="1">

<td style="width: 9.52237%;"></td>

<td style="width: 16.7386%;">
<p>multiply 3 by 85 to calculate the cost the labor cost for 3 hours</p>
<p>add 65 to include the call-out charge.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The total cost is $320</p>
</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p></p>
<p>Now suppose we saw that the total cost for a visit from the technician was $660. How many hours of labor must the technician have put into the repair?</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 66.7077%;" border="1">

<td style="width: 9.52237%;"></td>

<p>\(h=7\)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Check that this makes sense.</p>
<p>\(85(7)+65=595+65=660\)</p>
</td>
<td style="width: 16.7386%;">
<p>subtract 65 to remove the call-out charge.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br />The labor costs were $595</p>
<p><br />divide by 85 to determine how many hours will result in $585 labor cost.</p>
<p><br />The technician must have worked 7 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For 7 hours of labor, the total cost would be $660.</p>
