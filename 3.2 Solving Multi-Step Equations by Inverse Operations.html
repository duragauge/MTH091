<h1>3.2 Solving Multi-Step Equations by Inverse Operations</h1>
<p>In the morning, before I go to school or work, as part of my work to get ready for the day, I put on my socks. Then I put on my shoes. At the end of the day, before I go to bed, I have to undo all of that. In order to uno that sequence of actions, we prefer the inverse actions (take off socks/shoes rather than put on socks/shoes), and we do those inverse actions in the reverse order of how the actions were originally done. We put on socks, then shoes. We take off our shoes, then our socks.</p>

<h3>An Example with a Context</h3>
<p>A repair technician charges $85 per hour for work along with a $65 "call out" fee. The expression\(85h+65\) can be used to calculate the total cost for a visit from the repair technician, where \(h\) is the number of hours that they work.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to calculate the cost for a 3-hour repair.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate\(85*h+65\) for\(h=3\)</strong> <strong>Explanation</strong> \(\downarrow\)</p>
<p>\(85*3+65\)</p>

<p>\(255+65\)</p>

<p>\(320\)</p>
<p>multiply 3 by 85 to calculate the cost the labor cost for 3 hours</p>
<p>add 65 to include the call-out charge.</p>

<p>The total cost is $320</p>

<p>Now suppose we saw that the total cost for a visit from the technician was $660. How many hours of labor must the technician have put into the repair?</p>
<p><strong>Solve\(85*h+65=660\)</strong> <strong>Explanation</strong> \(\downarrow\)</p>
<p>\(85*h+65=660\) <br /> \(-65\) \(-65\)</p>

<p>\(85*h=595\)</p>

<p>\((85*h)/85=595/85\)</p>

<p>\(h=7\)</p>

<p>Check that this makes sense.</p>
<p>\(85(7)+65=595+65=660\)</p>
<p>subtract \(65\) to remove the call-out charge.</p>

<p><br />The labor costs were $595</p>
<p><br />divide by \(85\) to determine how many hours will result in $585 labor cost.</p>
<p><br />The technician must have worked 7 hours.</p>

<p>For 7 hours of labor, the total cost would be $660.</p>
