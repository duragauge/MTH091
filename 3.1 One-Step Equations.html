<p>Informally, we can think of an equation as a math sentence that includes an equals sign. The equals sign means "is the same as".</p>
<p>For example, the equation \(3+2 = 5\) tells us that \(2+3" is the same as "5\) .</p>
<p>Because \(3+2\) really does have the same value as \(5\) , this equation is an example of an <em>identity</em>- or "true equation".</p>
<p>On the other hand, the equation\(2 + 3 = 8\) is a <em>contradiction</em> - or "false equation".</p>
<p>Equations that contain variable quantities are more interesting because - in most cases - they could be true or they could be false. It all depends on the value used to replace the variable.</p>
<p>For example, the equation\(x + 4 = 9\) is true if\(x\) is replaced with\(5\) . However, if\(x\) is replaced with any value other than\(5\) the equation is false. An equation that could be true or could be false is called a <em>conditional equation</em>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not every equation that contains a variable is conditional. For example,\(x + 3 = x + 3\) is an identity, and\(x+7 = x+8\) is a contradiction.</p>
<p>Since the equation \(x + 4 = 9\) is true when\(x\) is replaced with \(5\) , we refer to\(5\) as the<em>solution</em> of the equation.</p>
<p>We typically give solutions in equation form - so in order to state the solution of the previous equation, we'd write: \(x = 5\)</p>
<p>One of the most important things we learn in Algebra is how to find the solution(s) of an equation. This process is called <em>solving</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mental Math vs. Algebraic Solving</strong></p>
<p>Some conditional equations contain very simple numbers and operations. When we encounter an equation like that, we can typically tell what the solution is simply by looking at it and applying our own number sense.</p>
<p>For example, consider this equation: \(3x = 6\)</p>
<p>If we have learned our multiplication facts, we know that\(3(2) = 6\) . Therefore, we know that the solution of the equation must be\(2\) .</p>
<p>We were able to solve that equation by using<em>mental math</em>. And while there's nothing inherently wrong with mental math, there are definite limitations to its usefulness.</p>
<p>For example, when presented with the equation \(3.835x = 62.894\) most people would not be able to tell what the solution is simply by looking at the equation and doing a quick calculation in their head. Because of that, it's very important that we understand how to solve equations algebraically</p>
<p>When solving an equation algebraically, we perform an operation (or series of operations) on <em>both</em> sides of the equation in order to get an<em>equivalent</em> equation that explicitly states the solution.</p>
<p>For the equation\(3x = 6\) we can divide both sides of the equation by\(3\) and the resulting equation will show us the solution:</p>
<p>\((3x)/3 = 6/3 -&gt; x = 2\)</p>
<p>In the previous example, notice that we had to divide<em>both</em> sides of the equation by 3 in order to get an equivalent equation. This notion is very important when it comes to solving equations, and it's not just true for division.All of the basic operations have properties of equality that must be followed. Those properties can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Inverse Operations</strong></p>
<p>Now that we've seen the importance of performing operations on<em>both</em> sides of an equation, we want to make sure we always know which operation to perform when solving. Since our goal is to end up with an equivalent equation in which the variable is isolated, we need to be able to get rid of any number that appears with the variable. This is done by using an <em>inverse operation</em> - an operation that will undo, or reverse the effect of, a given operation.</p>
<p>Here are three pairs of inverse operations:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inverse Operations</span> <br />Addition &amp; Subtraction<br />Multiplication &amp; Division<br />Exponents &amp; Roots</p>
<p>(In more advanced algebra courses, you will make use of a fourth pair of inverse operations: bases &amp; logarithms.)</p>

<p>The third pair of inverse operations - exponents and roots - are fairly straightforward if the exponent and/or root is odd.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see that an exponent of 3 and a 3rd root are inverse operations.</p>
<p>For example: \((-4)^3 = -64\) and \(root(3)(-64) = -4\)</p>
<p>Things get more complicated with even exponents and roots.</p>
<p>For example,\((-5)^4 = 625\) but \(root(4)(625) = 5\)</p>
<p>In this sequence of operations, we started with\(-5\) and raised it to the 4th power, which gave us a result of\(625\) . However, when we took the 4th root of\(625\) we got a result of\(5\) , which is<em>not</em> the number we originally started with.</p>
<p>Does this mean that an exponent of 4 and a 4th root are<em>not</em> inverse operations???</p>
<p>Not exactly. After all, when be begin with positive \(5\), we can see that the operations <em>do</em> undo each other:</p>
<p>\((5)^4 = 625\) and\(root(4)(625) = 5\)</p>
<p>So what went wrong when we began with\(-5\) ?</p>
<p>Well... it turns out that nothing went wrong. We just need to understand that every positive number has<em>two</em> 4th roots.</p>
<p>The positive (or principal) 4th root of 625 is \(root(4)(625) = 5\) and the negative (or secondary) 4th root of 625 is \(-root(4)(625) = -5\) .</p>
<p>We need to keep this in mind when solving equations in which a variable is raised to an even power.</p>

<p style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 4px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb;">In example 2 part (b), it was necessary to calculate a 5th root. You should know how to use your graphing calculator to find roots. Every calculator should have an easy-to-find square root button. However, for roots with bigger indexes, it can be more difficult. If you are using a TI-83 or TI-84, here are the steps for calculating a 5th root:</p>
<ol style="background-color: #eeeeee; padding: 25px; margin: 0; box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px #bbbbbb;">
<li>Begin your calculation by entering the number 5, since you want to do a 5th root.</li>
<li>Press the [MATH] button</li>
<li>Select \(root(x)()\)</li>
<li>Enter the number you're finding the 5th root of. For the example above, that would be -5.37824</li>
</ol>
</details>
<p></p>
<p>We'll finish off by looking at equations with roots. As discussed earlier, odd roots aren't particularly complicated. However, we need to be careful with equations involving even roots. When we are given an even root of a number, it is understood to be the <em>positive</em> (or principal) root. Because of that, it can't be set equal to a negative number.</p>
