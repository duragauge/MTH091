<h1>2.2 The Distributive Property</h1>
<h3>The Distributive Property</h3>
<p>The distributive property is given in the box below. It is an incredibly useful tool to manipulate algebraic expressions.</p>
<div><strong>The Distributive Property:</strong>
<p><strong>\(a(b+c)=a\cdot b+a\cdot c\)</strong></p>
<p><strong>\(a(b-c)=a\cdot b-a\cdot c\)</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Before we focus on using the distributive property with algebraic expressions, it is useful to point out that the idea of the distributive property is something that you are already familiar with.</p>
<p>Imagine that you take a temporary job working for a vendor at the state fair. You will work for 2 days and are going to earn $15 for each hour that you work. Does it matter if the vendor pays you for your hours at the end of each day or if they wait until the end of both days to pay you? Your experience most likely leads you to correctly says that it doesn't matter; the amount you will get paid is the same either way. That's because you already know about the distributive property!</p>
<p>Let's say you work 7 hours on the first day and 9 hours on the second day. If the vendor waits until the end of the two days to calculate your pay, the calculation would look like this:</p>
<p>\("total earnings "\)</p>
<p>\(=($15" per hour")(" day 1 hours " + " day 2 hours ") \)</p>
<p>\(=($15 " per hour")(7 " hours " + " "9 " hours ")\)</p>
<p>\(=($15 " per hour")(16 " hours")\)</p>
<p>\(=$240\)</p>
<p>If instead you get paid at the end of each day, then your total earnings would be calculated as</p>
<p>\("total earnings " \)</p>
<p>\(= " day 1 earnings " + " day 2 earnings "\)</p>
<p>\(= ($15 " per hour")(7 " hours")+($15 " per hour")(9 " hours") \)</p>
<p>\(= $105+$135\)</p>
<p>\(=$240\)</p>
<p>This is exactly the distributive property!</p>
<p>\(a(b+c)=ab+ac\)</p>
<p>\(15(7+9)=15(7)+15(9)\)</p>
< 
<h3>Examples of Distributing Multiplication by a Number</h3>
<p>Consider the expression\(3(4-9)\) . There are two ways we could evaluate this, but we'll get the same result either way.</p>
<p>Option 1. Use the order of operations:</p>
<p>\(3(4-9)\)</p>
<p>\(=3(-5)\)</p>
<p>\(=-15\)</p>
<p>Option 2. Use the distributive property:</p>
<p>\(3(4-9)\)</p>
<p>\(=3(4)-3(9)\)</p>
<p>\(=12-27\)</p>
<p>\(=-15\)</p>
<p>Here is an example of distributing multiplication by a number. This example involves an algebraic expression.</p>
<p>\(-2.5(3x-4)\)</p>
<p>\(=-2.5(3x)-(-2.5)(4)\)</p>
<p>\(=-7.5x-(-10)\)</p>
<p>\(=-7.5x+10\)</p>
< 
<h3>Distributing Monomials</h3>
<p>Before we talk about the distributive property here, we need to talk a little bit about exponents and multiplying variables together.</p>
<p>We know that an exponent is used to indicate repeatedly multiplying the same quantity together.</p>
<p>\(3*3*3*3=3^4\)</p>
<p>We can use exponents with variables as well.</p>
<p>\(w*w*w*w*w=w^5\)</p>
<p>Later on in the term, we will learn some rules for working with exponents, but for now, we will keep coming back to this concept that an exponent on a variable means the variable is multiplied together multiple times.</p>
<p>Here are a few more examples before we move on to the distributive property with variables.</p>
<p>\(x^3*x^2\)</p>
<p>\(=(x*x*x)*(x*x)\)</p>
<p>\(=x*x*x*x*x \)</p>
<p>\(=x^5\)</p>
< 
<p>\(6t^5*2t^3\)</p>
<p>\(=(6)(2)(t*t*t*t*t)*(t*t*t)\)</p>
<p>\(=t*t*t*t*t*t*t*t \)</p>
<p>\(=t^8\)</p>
<p>Okay! We are ready to get back to the distributive property.</p>
<p>\(3x(-2x+5)\)</p>
<p>\(=(3x)(-2x)+(3x)(5)\)</p>
<p>\(=(3)(-2)x*x+(3)(5)x\)</p>
<p>\(=-6x*x+15x\)</p>
<p>\(=-6x^2+15x\)</p>
< 
<p>\(-3x^2(5x^5-7x)\)</p>
<p>\(=(-3x^2)(5x^5)-(-3x^2)(7x)\)</p>
<p>\(=(-3)(5)x^2*x^5-(-3)(7)x^2*x\)</p>
<p>\(=-15x*x*x*x*x*x*x-(-21)x*x*x\)</p>
<p>\(=-15x^7+21x^3\)</p>
< 
<p><strong>Distributing Binomials</strong></p>
<p>If we want to multiply \((3x-2)(5x+4)\)we can use the distributive property. We will distribute the\((3x-2)\) to both the\(5x\) and the 4.</p>
<p>\((3x-2)(5x+4)\)</p>
<p>\(=(3x-2)(5x)+(3x+2)(4)\)</p>
<p>\(=5x(3x-2)+4(3x+2)\)</p>
<p>\(=(5x)(3x)-(5x)(2)+(4)(3x)+4(2)\)</p>
<p>\(=(5)(3)x*x-(5)(2)x+(4)(3)x+4(2)\)</p>
<p>\(=15x^2-10x+12x+8\)</p>
<p>\(=15x^2+2x+8\)</p>
< 
<p>Here is another example.</p>
<p>\((-2x+4)(5x-1)\)</p>
<p>\(=(-2x+1)(5x)-(-2x+4)(1)\)</p>
<p><strong>What is the preferred way to handle this one? </strong></p>
< 
<p>When multiplying two binomials, a process called the FOIL method is sometimes used to find the product. It is called FOIL because we multiply the <strong>F</strong>irst terms, the <strong>O</strong>uter terms, the <strong>I</strong>nner terms, and then the <strong>L</strong>ast terms of each binomial.</p>
<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip0-1686773957383.png"/></p>
<p>The FOIL method arises out of the distributive property. We are simply multiplying each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial, and then combining like terms.</p>
<p>Given two binomials, then, we can use FOIL to simplify the expression by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Multiply the FIRST terms of each binomial.</li>
<li>Multiply the OUTER terms of the binomials.</li>
<li>Multiply the INNER terms of the binomials.</li>
<li>Multiply the LAST terms of each binomial.</li>
<li>Add the products.</li>
<li>Combine like terms and simplify.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Use the FOIL method to find the product: \((2x - 9)(3x + 4)\)</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>The product of the first terms is \((2x)(3x) = 6x^2\)</p>
<p>The product of the outer terms is \((2x)(4) = 8x\)</p>
<p>The product of the inner terms is \((-9)(3x) = -27x\)</p>
<p>The product of the last terms is \((-9)(4) = -36\)</p>
\(6x^2+8x-27x-36\)
<p>Add the products.</p>
\(6x^2-19x-36\)
<p>Combine like terms.</p>
< 
<p>Let’s look at a few more examples of multiplying binomial pairs using the FOIL method.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Use the FOIL method to multiply each pair of binomials.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> \((x+2)(x+9)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+9x+2x+18\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+11x+18\)</p>
< 
<p><strong>2.</strong> \((x+7)(x-3)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-3x+7x-21\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+4x-21\)</p>
< 
<p><strong>3. </strong>\((x-6)(x-1)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-1x-6x+6\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-7x+6\)</p>
<h3>Difference of Squares</h3>
<p>A notable pattern occurs when we multiply a binomial by another binomial with the same terms but the opposite sign. Binomial pairs of this type are called <strong>conjugate pairs</strong>. Let’s see what happens when we multiply conjugate pairsusing the FOIL method.</p>
<p>\((x + 4)(x - 4)\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(x^2-4x+4x-16\)
 
<p>=</p>
\(x^2 - 16\)
<p>The middle term is the sum of opposites, in this case -4\(x\) and 4\(x\). The sum is 0\(x\) = 0. So in effect, the middle term drops out, resulting in a <strong>difference of squares</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few more examples.</p>
<p>\((x + 5)(x - 5)\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(x^2-5x+5x-25=x^2-25\)
<p>\((x + 11)(x - 11)\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(x^2-11x+11x-121=x^2-121\)
<p>\((2x + 3)(2x - 3)\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\(4x^2-6x+6x-9=4x^2-9\)
<p>Noticing the pattern of the products, we can write a general formula and use it as a 'shortcut' when multiplying conjugate pairs.</p>

<p>For real numbers<em>a</em> and<em>b</em>, \((a+b)(a-b)=a^2-b^2\)</p>
