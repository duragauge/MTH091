<h1>2.2 The Distributive Property</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Suppose a store is offering 10\% off every item in stock.  This discount could be applied two different ways: either by reducing the price of each item individually or by calculating the total price of everything and then applying the discount.</p>

<p>As you probably know from experience, both methods give the same final result.  What you might not know, however, is <em>why</em> the results are the same. That's what we'll explore in this section.</p>

<h3>The Distributive Property</h3>
<p>It's important to point out that the example in the introduction is an example of a special property that doesn't hold true for all mathematical expressions. In most cases, we can't simply rearrange the order of addition and multiplication without changing the outcome.</p>

<p>However, as the example illustrates, in the special case where the same number is multiplying multiple different values, there are two equivalent ways to evaluate the expression.  This is relationship called the <strong>distributive property</strong>.</p>

<div style="width:600px; margin:1.2em; background:#d8f7d8; border-radius:15px; border:2px solid #228b22; padding:10px;">
<strong>The Distributive Property:</strong>
    <p>For any numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\),</p>
    \begin{align}
        a(b+c) &= a\cdot b+a\cdot c \\
    \end{align}
</div>

<p>Many people find it helpful to draw arrows to indicate the multiplications that flow from applying the distributive property.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/84239/distributive_property.svg" alt="" width="213" height="45" /></p>

<p>The distributive property also holds for subtraction: \(a(b-c)=a \cdot b - a \cdot c\) and can be extended to have multiple values inside the parenthesis including variables.  It's also possible to distribute not just single numbers but entire expressions!  We'll walk through examples of all of those below.</p>

<h3>Distributing Numbers</h3>
<p>Consider the expression \(3(4-9)\). Let's work through evaluating it the standard way and also using the distributive property, just to show the answers are the same.</p>

<p>Option 1. Use the order of operations:</p>
\begin{align}
    3(4-9) &= 3(-5) \\
    &=-15
\end{align}

<p>Option 2. Use the distributive property:</p>
\begin{align}
    3(4-9) &= 3(4)-3(9) \\
    &=12-27 \\
    &=-15
\end{align}

<p>When distributing an integer, be extra careful with any negative signs. </p>

\begin{align}
    -2(-3+5) &= -2(-3)+(-2)(5) \\
    &= 6-10 \\
    &= -3
\end{align}

In particular, if there is no number indicated
<p>Many times the expression in the parenthesis will involve variables, as in this example.</p>

\begin{align}
    -2.5(3x-4) &= -2.5(3x)-(-2.5)(4) \\
    &= -7.5x-(-10) \\
    &= -7.5x+10
\end{align}


<h3>Distributing Monomials</h3>
<p>Before we talk about the distributive property here, we need to talk a little bit about exponents and multiplying variables together.</p>

<p>We know that an exponent is used to indicate repeatedly multiplying the same quantity together.</p>

\[3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3=3^4\]

<p>We can use exponents with variables as well.</p>

\[w \cdot w \cdot w \cdot w \cdot w=w^5\]

<p>Later on in this chapter we will learn some rules for working with exponents but, for now, we will keep coming back to this concept that an exponent on a variable means the variable is multiplied together multiple times.</p>

<p>Here are a few more examples before we move on to the distributive property with variables.</p>

\begin{align}
    x^3 \cdot x^2 &= (x \cdot x \cdot x) (x \cdot x) \\
    &= x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \\
    &=x^5
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    6t^5 \cdot 2t^3 &=(6)(2)(t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t)(t \cdot t \cdot t) \\
    &=t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \cdot t \\
    &= t^8
\end{align}

<p>Okay! We are ready to get back to the distributive property.</p>

\begin{align}
    3x(-2x+5) &= (3x)(-2x)+(3x)(5) \\
    &=(3)(-2)x \cdot x+(3)(5)x \\
    &=-6x \cdot x+15x \\
    &=-6x^2+15x
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    -3x^2(5x^5-7x) &= (-3x^2)(5x^5)-(-3x^2)(7x) \\
    &= (-3)(5)x^2 \cdot x^5-(-3)(7)x^2 \cdot x \\
    &= -15x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x-(-21)x \cdot x \cdot x \\
    &= -15x^7+21x^3
\end{align}


<h3>Distributing Binomials</h3>
<p>If we want to multiply \((3x-2)(5x+4)\)we can use the distributive property. We will distribute the\((3x-2)\) to both the\(5x\) and the 4.</p>

\begin{align}
    (3x-2)(5x+4) &= (3x-2)(5x)+(3x+2)(4) \\
    &= 5x(3x-2)+4(3x+2) \\
    &= (5x)(3x)-(5x)(2)+(4)(3x)+4(2) \\
    &= (5)(3)x \cdot x-(5)(2)x+(4)(3)x+4(2) \\
    &= 15x^2-10x+12x+8\ \\
    &= 15x^2+2x+8
\end{align}

<p>Here is another example.</p>

\begin{align}
    (-2x+4)(5x-1) &= (-2x+1)(5x)-(-2x+4)(1)
\end{align}
<p>What is the preferred way to handle this one? </p>

<p>When multiplying two binomials, a process called the FOIL method is sometimes used to find the product. It is called FOIL because we multiply the First terms, the Outer terms, the Inner terms, and then the Last terms of each binomial.</p>

<p><img src="https://myopenmaths3.s3.amazonaws.com/ufiles/2696375/mceclip0-1686773957383.png"/></p>

<p>The FOIL method arises out of the distributive property. We are simply multiplying each term of the first binomial by each term of the second binomial, and then combining like terms.</p>

<p>Given two binomials, then, we can use FOIL to simplify the expression by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Multiply the FIRST terms of each binomial.</li>
    <li>Multiply the OUTER terms of the binomials.</li>
    <li>Multiply the INNER terms of the binomials.</li>
    <li>Multiply the LAST terms of each binomial.</li>
    <li>Add the products.</li>
    <li>Combine like terms and simplify.</li>
</ol>

    <strong>Example</strong>
    <p>Use the FOIL method to find the product: \((2x - 9)(3x + 4)\)</p>
</div>
<div style="width:600px; margin:0 1.2em 1.2em 1.2em; background:#cceeff; border-radius: 0px 0px 15px 15px; border:1px solid #0066ff;border-width:0 2px 2px 2px; padding:5px 10px 15px 10px;">
    <strong>Solution</strong>
    <ol>    
    <li>The product of the first terms is \((2x)(3x) = 6x^2\)</li>
    <li>The product of the outer terms is \((2x)(4) = 8x\)</li>
    <li>li>The product of the inner terms is \((-9)(3x) = -27x\)</li>
    <li>The product of the last terms is \((-9)(4) = -36\)</li>
    <li>Add the products.  \(6x^2+8x-27x-36\)</li>
    <li>Combine like terms.\(6x^2-19x-36\)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Let's look at a few more examples of multiplying binomial pairs using the FOIL method.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Use the FOIL method to multiply each pair of binomials.</p>
<p>1. \((x+2)(x+9)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+9x+2x+18\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+11x+18\)</p>

<p>2. \((x+7)(x-3)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-3x+7x-21\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2+4x-21\)</p>

<p>3. \((x-6)(x-1)\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-1x-6x+6\)</p>
<p>\(=x^2-7x+6\)</p>

<h3>Difference of Squares</h3>
<p>A notable pattern occurs when we multiply a binomial by another binomial with the same terms but the opposite sign. Binomial pairs of this type are called conjugate pairs. Let's see what happens when we multiply conjugate pairs using the FOIL method.</p>

\begin{align}
    (x + 4)(x - 4) &= x^2-4x+4x-16 \\
    &=x^2 - 16
\end{align}

<p>The middle term is the sum of opposites, in this case -4\(x\) and 4\(x\). The sum is 0\(x\) = 0. So in effect, the middle term drops out, resulting in a difference of squares.</p>
<p>Let's look at a few more examples.</p>

\begin{align}
    (x + 5)(x - 5) &= x^2-5x+5x-25 \\
    &= x^2-25
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    (x + 11)(x - 11) &= x^2-11x+11x-121 \\
    &= x^2-121
\end{align}

\begin{align}
    (2x + 3)(2x - 3) &= 4x^2-6x+6x-9 \\
    &= 4x^2-9
\end{align}

<p>Noticing the pattern of the products, we can write a general formula and use it as a shortcut when multiplying conjugate pairs.</p>
