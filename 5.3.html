        <h1>5.3 Graphing Linear Equations</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the last section, we had to create a list of points to graph a line.  In this section, we will introduce a new tool, called the <strong>slope-intercept form</strong> of a line, that lets us to extract information without having to calculate any points.</p>

<div class="keep-together">
<h2>The Slope Intercept Form</h2>
<p>Let's begin with a practical situation. As we walk through this carefully we'll uncover exactly what this slope intercept form is and what makes it useful.</p>
</div>

<p>Imagine a landscape supply company charges \(\$25\) per cubic yard for bark mulch and an additional flat \(\$35\) delivery fee. When ordering bark, the total cost will start at \(\$35\) and will go up at a rate of \(\$25\) for each cubic yard ordered.</p>

<p>If we let \(x\) represent the number of cubic yards of bark and let \(y\) represent the total cost, then the equation for total cost becomes \(y=25x+35\).  Let's make a table of values for this equation and plot those points.</p>

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; margin:1.2em;" border="1">
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">\(x\) <br> (cubic yards)</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">0</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">1</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">2</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">3</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">4</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">5</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">\(y=25x+35\) <br> (total cost in $)</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$35</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$60</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$85</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$110</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$135</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$160</td>
        <td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px;">$285</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width: 300px; height: auto;"><img  loading="lazy" src="images/desmos-graph_46.png" alt="Plot of data points with a line drawn through them starting.  Horizontal axis is labeled for 'cubic yards of bark' and vertical axis is 'costs."></p>

<p>This graph is clearly a line and the point where the line crosses the \(y\)-axis is \((0,35)\). Notice that the \(y\)-coordinate of this point is the constant in our equation \(y=25x+35\).</p>

<div class="keep-together">
<p>What is the slope of the line? We can use any two points from the table to find out. Let's use \((5, 160)\) and \((10, 285\)).</p> 
\begin{align}
    m &= \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\
    &= \frac{285-160}{10-5} \\
    &= \frac{125}{5} \\
    &= 25
\end{align}

<p>Remarkably, this value is also in our equation as the coefficient of \(x\).  In our scenario, it represents the rate of change of the cost: \(\$25\) <em>per</em> cubic yard of bark.</p>
</div>

<p>The fact that both the slope and \(y\)-intercept can both be identified just from the equation is an amazing shortcut. This holds true for any equation in the form \(y=mx+b\).</p>

<div class="box box--idea">
    <strong>Linear Equations:</strong>
    <p>Any equation that can be put in the form \(y=mx+b\) is a <strong>linear equation</strong>.  Its graph will be a straight line.  Additionally,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\(m\) represents the slope or rate of change of the line.</li>
        <li>The point \((0,b)\) is the \(y\)-intercept of the line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The format \(y=mx+b\) is called the <strong>slope-intercept</strong> form of a line</p>
</div>

<p>The slope-intercept form is a powerful tool for understanding and working with linear equations and their graphs.</p>

<div class="box box--example">
  <div class="example-title"><span class="sr-only">Example </span></div>
    <p>Identify the slope and \(y\)-intercept of the following lines.</p>

    <p><b>b.</b> \(y=\frac{2}{5}x-7\)</p>
    <h4 class="sr-only">Solution</h4>
<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>Since both equations are in the slope-intercept form, the slope and \(y\)-intercept can be identified from the equation without any calculations.</p>

    <p><b>b.</b> \(y=\frac{2}{5}x-7\) has a slope of \(m=\frac{2}{5}\) and a \(y\)-intercept at \((0,-7)\).</p>

    <h4 class="sr-only">Solution</h4>
<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>If we use the slope intercept form, the values for \(m\) and \(b\) can be substituted in directly.</p>
    <p><b>a.</b> \(y=3x+12\) has a slope of \(m=3\) and a \(y\)-intercept at \((0,12)\).</p>
    <p><b>b.</b> \(y=\frac{-5}{6}x+8\) has a slope of \(m=\frac{-5}{6}\) and a \(y\)-intercept at \((0,8)\).</p>
</div>


<h2>Graphing Linear Equations in Slope-Intercept Form</h2>
<p>Graphing linear equations becomes intuitive when they're in slope-intercept form.</p>


<p>To graph a line in slope-intercept form, first plot the point \((0,b)\), which is the \(y\)-intercept. Then, starting from the \(y\)-intercept, use the rise of the slope to move up or down and the run of the slope to move side-to-side and plot a second point.  Use those two points to draw the line.</p>

<div class="box box--example">
  <div class="example-title"><span class="sr-only">Example </span></div>
    <p>Graph the line \(y=\frac{3}{2}x+1\).</p>
    <h4 class="sr-only">Solution</h4>
<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>Since this is in the slope-intercept form we know the \(y\)-intercept is \(\color{blue}{(0,1)}\). Starting from that point we'll use the slope \(\color{red}{\frac{3}{2}}\) and move up \(\color{red}{3}\) spaces and right \(\color{red}{2}\) to plot a second point.</p>

<div class="keep-together">
<h2>Writing the Slope-Intercept Form of a Line Given Its Graph</h2>
<p>If you're given the graph of a line, it's possible to extract the slope and \(y\)-intercept directly from it.  The \(y\)-intercept should be straightforward to spot, since it is where the line crosses the \(y\)-aixis.  The slope is not much harder, but we need to be precise.</p>
</div>

<p>To find the slope, find another point on the line where you are confident of it's coordinates.  Then carefully count the rise and run between that point and your \(y\)-intercept.  Make sure the sign of your final slope value matches the direction of the line.  As we saw in the last section, lines with positive slope rise when moving left to right while lines with negative slope go down.</p>

    <h4 class="sr-only">Solution</h4>
<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,2)\), so \(b=2\). The slope appears to be \(m=\frac{-4}{3}\). From this we conclude the equation of the line must be</p>
    \[y=\frac{-4}{3}x+2\]

<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>The \(y\)-intercept is \((0,3)\), so \(b=3\). The slope appears to be \(m=\frac{5}{2}\). From this we conclude the equation of the line must be</p>
    \[y=\frac{5}{2}x+3\]
</div>
</div>

<div class="keep-together">
<h2>Finding the Slope-Intercept Form Given Two Points</h2>
<p>If we are given two points instead of a graph then it's still possible to find the equation of the line that goes through them.  It is an involved process, so we'll walk through the process together.</p>
</div>


<div class="keep-together">
<p>For our example, let's use the points \((2,5)\) as \((x_1,y_1)\) and \((6,-1)\) as \((x_2,y_2)\).  We'll start with the slope formula.</p>

\[
  \begin{align}
    m &= \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1} && \hint{\text{slope formula}} \newline
    &= \frac{-1 - 5}{6-2} && \hint{\text{insert coordinates of the two points}} \newline
    &= \frac{-6}{4} && \hint{\text{evaluate the subtractions}} \newline
    &= -\frac{3}{2} && \hint{\text{reduce the fraction}} \newline
  \end{align}
\] 
</div>

<div class="keep-together">
<p>The only part of the slope-intercept form that is missing from our equation is the \(y\)-intercept \(b\).  Since neither of our points was the \(y\)-intercept, we will need to put the coordinates of one of our points, along with the slope we just calculated, into the slope-intercept equation and solve for $b$.  We will use the point \((2,5)\) and, of course, \(m = \frac{-3}{2}\).</p>

\[
  \begin{align}
    y &= m x + b && \hint{\text{slope-intercept form}} \newline
    5 &= -\frac{3}{2}(2)+b && \hint{\text{insert the slope and the coordinates of the point}} \newline
    5 &= -3+b && \hint{\text{simplify}} \newline
    8 &= b && \hint{\text{add $3$ to both sides}}
  \end{align}
\]
</div>

<p>With both \(m\) and \(b\) in hand, we can now say that $y=\frac{-3}{2}x+8$ is the line that goes through the points \((2,5)\) and \((6,-1)\).</p>

<div class="keep-together">
<h2>Interpreting the Slope and Y-Intercept</h2>
<p>Linear equations are used to model various real-world situations. Understanding what the slope and y-intercept mean in context can allow us to construct an equation in slope-intercept form for a given scenario.</p>
</div>

<p>As we discussed in section 5.2, slope is a rate of change. A <strong>rate</strong> is ratio of two quantities.  Such rates are often described using the word <em>per</em> (miles <em>per</em> gallon, servings <em>per</em> package, dollars <em>per</em> hour, feet <em>per</em> second) or something equivalent (two tickets <em>for each</em> person, ten-thousand steps <em>every</em> day, etc.).</p>

<p>If a situation has a constant rate of change, that value is the slope.  In our introductory bark example, the slope was \(25\) since the price changed at a rate of \(\$25\) <em>per</em> cubic yard.</p>

<p>Since the \(y\)-intercept occurs when \(x=0\), the value \(b\) is usually a starting value or an initial amount.  In our bark example \(b=35\) because every order started with a flat deliery charge of \(\$35\).</p>

<div class="box box--example">
  <div class="example-title"><span class="sr-only">Example </span></div>
    <p>Suppose a gym has an initial joining fee of \(\$50\) and monthly membership fee of \(\$20\). Construct an equation in slope-intercept form that represents the situation.</p>
    <h4 class="sr-only">Solution</h4>
<hr class="solution-sep">
    <p>In this scenario, the initial signup fee is the \(y\)-intercept and the monthly fee is the slope.  Using \(m=20\) and \(b=50\), the equation of the line is:</p>
    \[ y = 20x + 50 \]
     <p>This linear equation allows us to calculate the total cost of being a member at the gym membership for \(x\) months.</p>
</div>

<div class="keep-together">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The slope-intercept form of a line stands as the most used linear model across math, science, engineering, and countless other fields. Almost anytime anyone asks for a line, they are likely looking for \(y=mx+b\).</p>

<p>In the next section our focus shifts and we'll begin looking at graphs of nonlinear quadratic equations.</p>
