<h1>4.3 The Quadratic Formula</h1>



<p>One method of solving quadratic equations is by using the quadratic formula, a formula that will solve all quadratic equations. We can derive the quadratic formula by yet another solving method called "completing the square". Since the method of completing the square is not covered in this course, we omit the derivation of the formula and just present the result below.</p>

    <strong>The Quadratic Formula</strong>
    <p>If a quadratic equation is written in the standard form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers with \(a \ne 0\), then the solutions are:</p>
    \begin{align}
        x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
    \end{align}
</div>

<p>A quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the equation is in standard form and set equal to zero: \(ax^2+bx+c=0\)</li>
    <li>Make note of the values of the coefficients and constant term, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).</li>
    <li>Carefully substitute the values noted in Step 2 into the equation. To avoid needless errors, use parentheses around each number input into the formula.</li>
    <li>Calculate and solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although the quadratic formula works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to make errors in substituting the values into the formula. Pay close attention when substituting, and use parentheses, especially when inserting a negative number. You will also need to make sure that both terms in the numerator are divided by the denominator.</p>

    <strong>Example 1</strong>
    <p>Solve \(x^2+2x-15=0\) for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
    <hr>
    <strong>Solution</strong>
    <p>The equation is in the standard form, equal to zero, and the coefficients are \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -15\). We can solve this with the quadratic formula.</p>
    \begin{align}
        x &= \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{The quadratic formula}} \\
        x &= \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{(2)^2-4(1)(-15)}}{2(1)} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Substitute } a = 1, b = 2, c = -15} \\
        x &= \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Simplify inside the square root.}} \\
        x &= \frac{-2 \pm 8}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{Evaluate the square root}} \\
        x &= \frac{-2 + 8}{2} && \small \color{#5fa2ce} {\text{ or } x = \frac{-2 - 8}{2} \text{Write as two equations.}} \\
        x &= 3 \text{ or } x = -5 \text{Compute.}
    \end{align}
</div>

where the steps are on the right side of the equation?

<p>Notice in the second to last step, the fraction bar is extended below both terms in the numerator. Both terms are divided by 2. In this problem, the calculation is easy to do using mental math, but if we use a calculator to simplify an expression such as this, we must use two separate steps or put parentheses around the numerator.</p>



<p>The equation used in Example 1 can also be solved by factoring and applying the zero-product property.</p>

<div>
    \begin{align}
        &x^2+2x-15=0 \text{ becomes} \\
        &(x - 3)(x + 5) = 0 \\
        &\text{So either} \\
        &x - 3 = 0 \text{ or } x + 5 = 0 \\
        &\text{and } x = 3 \text{ or } x = -5.
    \end{align}
</div>

<p>We obtain the same solutions using either method. The next example has a quadratic equation that cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula to solve.</p>

    <h3>Example 2</h3>
    <p>For \(3x^2=9x-4\), solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
</div>

<div>
    \begin{align}
        &\textbf{Solution} \\
        &\text{We rewrite the equation in standard form by setting the equation equal to } 0. \\
        &3x^2 = 9x - 4 \text{ (Original equation)} \\
        &3x^2 - 9x = -4 \text{ (Subtract } 9x \text{ from both sides)} \\
        &3x^2 - 9x + 4 = 0 \text{ (Add } 4 \text{ to both sides)} \\
        &\text{Identify the coefficients: } a = 3, b = -9, c = 4. \text{ Then use the quadratic formula.} \\
        &x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\
        &x = \frac{-(-9) \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2-4(3)(4)}}{2(3)} \\
        &\text{Substitute } a = 3, b = -9, \text{ and } c = 4 \text{ in the quadratic formula.} \\
        &x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{33}}{6} \\
        &\text{Simplify.} \\
        &\text{The solutions to the equation are } \frac{9+\sqrt{33}}{6} \text{ and } \frac{9-\sqrt{33}}{6}. \\
        &\text{Rounded to three decimal places, the approximate solutions are: } x \approx 2.457 \text{ and } x \approx 0.543
