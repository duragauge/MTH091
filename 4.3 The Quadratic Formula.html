<h1>4.3 The Quadratic Formula</h1>
<p>One method of solving quadratic equations is by using the quadratic formula, a formula that will solve all quadratic equations. We can derive the quadratic formula by yet another solving method called “completing the square”. Since the method of completing the square is not covered in this course, we omit the derivation of the formula and just present the result below.</p>
<div>
<p>The Quadratic Formula</p>
<p>If a quadratic equation is written in the standard form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers with \(a \ne 0\) , then the solutions are:</p>
<p>\(x=(-b+-\sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)\)</p>
</div>
<p>A quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the equation is in standard form and set equal to zero: \(ax^2+bx+c=0\)</li>
<li>Make note of the values of the coefficients and constant term, \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).</li>
<li>Carefully substitute the values noted in Step 2 into the equation. To avoid needless errors, use parentheses around each number input into the formula.</li>
<li>Calculate and solve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the quadratic formula works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to make errors in substituting the values into the formula. Pay close attention when substituting, and use parentheses, especially when inserting a negative number. You will also need to make sure that both terms in the numerator are divided by the denominator.</p>
<div>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>For \(x^2+2x-15=0\) solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Identify the coefficients: \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = -15\). Then use the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\((-b+-\sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a)\)
<p>The quadratic formula</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\((-2+-\sqrt((2)^2-4(1)(-15)))/(2(1)\)
<p>Substitute: \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -15\)</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\((-2+-\sqrt(64))/2\)
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
\((-2+-8)/2\)
<p>Simplify further: \(\sqrt(64) = 8\)</p>
\(x=(-2+8)/2\)
<p>or</p>
\(x=(-2-8)/2\)
<p>Write as two equations.</p>
<p>\(x = 3\)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>\(x = -5\)</p>
<p>Compute.</p>
</div>
<p>Notice in the second to last step, the fraction bar is extended below both terms in the numerator. Both terms are divided by 2. In this problem, the calculation is easy to do using mental math, but if we use a calculator to simplify an expression such as this, we must use two separate steps or put parentheses around the numerator.</p>
<p>For \(x^2+2x-15=0\) , the related quadratic function is \(y=x^2+2x-15\) . Enter the equation into the calculator and find a good viewing window. The solutions to the quadratic equation, \(x = 3\) and \(x = -5\), can be entered as values while in TRACE mode.</p>

<p>The equation used in Example 1 can also be solved by factoring and applying the zero product property.</p>
<p>\(x^2+2x-15=0\) becomes</p>
<p>\((x - 3)(x + 5) = 0\)</p>
<p>So either</p>
<p>\(x - 3 = 0\) or \(x + 5 = 0\)</p>
<p>and \(x = 3\) or \(x = -5\).</p>
<p>We obtain the same solutions using either method. The next example has a quadratic equation that cannot be factored, so we use the quadratic formula to solve.</p>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>For\(3x^2=9x-4\) solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>We rewrite the equation in standard form by setting the equation equal to 0.</p>
<p>\(3x^2\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\(9x - 4\)</p>
<p>Original equation</p>
<p>\(3x^2-9x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>-4</p>
<p>Subtract \(9x\) from both sides.</p>
<p>\(3x^2-9x+4\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>Add 4 to both sides.</p>
<p>Identify the coefficients: \(a = 3\), \(b = -9\), \(c = 4\). Then use the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((--9+-\sqrt((-9)^2-4(3)(4)))/(2(3))\)</p>
<p>Substitute \(a = 3\), \(b = -9\), and \(c = 4\) in the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((9+-\sqrt(33))/6\)</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>The solutions to the equation are \( \) \((9+\sqrt(33))/6\) and \((9-\sqrt(33))/6\) .</p>
<p>Rounded to three decimal places the approximate solutions are: x = 2.457 and x = 0.543</p>
<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>For\(4x^2-20x+25\) solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>Identify the coefficients: \(a = 4\), \(b = -20\), \(c = 25\). Then use the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((--20+-\sqrt((-20)^2-4(4)(25)))/(2(4))\)</p>
<p>Substitute \(a = 4\), \(b = -20\), and \(c = 25\) in the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((20+-\sqrt(0))/8\)</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\(20/8\) \(\sqrt0=0\)</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\(5/2=2.5\)</p>
<p>Reduce the fraction.</p>
<p>This time we found only one solution, \(x = 2.5\).</p>

<p>In example 4 we use the quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation that has imaginary-number solutions.</p>
<h3>Example 4</h3>
<p>For\(-5x^2-5=-8x\) solve for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>We rewrite the equation in standard form by setting the equation equal to 0.</p>
<p>\(-5x^2-5\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\(-8x\)</p>
<p>Original equation</p>
<p>\(-5x^2+8x-5\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>Add \(8x\) to both sides and write in standard form</p>
<p>Identify the coefficients: \(a = -5\), \(b = 8\), \(c = -5\). Then use the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((-8+-\sqrt((8)^2-4(-5)(-5)))/(2(-5))\)</p>
<p>Substitute \(a = -5\), \(b = 8\), and \(c = -5\) in the quadratic formula.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((-8+-\sqrt(-36))/-10\)</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((-8+-6i)/-10\)</p>
<p>Square root of a negative number:\(\sqrt(-36) = +-6i\)</p>
<p>\(x\)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>\((4+-3i)/5\)</p>
<p>Reduce the fraction. Divide each term by -2.</p>
<p>The solutions to the equation are the two complex numbers: \(x=(4+3i)/5\)and \(x=(4-3i)/5\). These are notreal numbers because they include the imaginary unit\(i = \sqrt(-1)\) .</p>

<p>Note to our students:</p>
<p>You should solve a few quadratic equations ‘by hand’ using the quadratic formula. Once you understand how to apply the formula, your professor may want you to download a quadratic formula program onto your calculator. This will allow you to solve more complex or multi-faceted problems quickly without getting bogged down in one computation.</p>
<p>Ask your professor about obtaining the quadratic formula program for your graphing calculator. It only takes a few seconds to transfer the program from one calculator to another using a connector cable.</p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>
<p>A batter hits a fast pitch at a baseball game. The height of the baseball (in feet) \(x\) seconds after it has been hit can be modeled by the function</p>
<p>\(y = -16x^2+120x + 3.5\)</p>
<p>When does the baseball land?</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>The baseball lands when the output, the height is 0 feet. We can find this by solving the following equation for \(x\).</p>
<p>\(-16x^2+120x+3.5=0\)</p>
<p>This is most easily solved with a quadratic formula program on a calculator where \(a = -16\), \(b = 120\), and \(c = 3.5\). The solutions, rounded to three decimal places, are \(x \approx -0.029\) and \(x \approx 7.529\).</p>
<p>The first solution \(x \approx -0.029\) is a negative value that would suggest going back in time before the baseball was hit by the batter. This value makes no sense in the context of the problem and is an example of model breakdown.</p>
<p>The second solution \(x \approx 7.529\) means that the height of the ball will be \(0\) feet after approximately \(7.529\) seconds. Or more plainly, it will take \(7.529\) seconds for the baseball to land.</p>
