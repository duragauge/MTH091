4.1 Solving through Simplification

Introduction

In the previous sections we explored equations where the variable only appeared once.  We now move on to equations where the variable occurs in multiple places and could even appear on both sides. This presents a new set of challenges and techniques.

Solving Equations with the Variable on Both Sides

Up until now, we've tackled equations where the variable was isolated on one side. But what if the variable appears on both sides? The process remains the same, but now we'll need to perform additional steps to isolate the variable.

Example 1

Let's take an equation: \(3x + 5 = 2x + 10\). To solve this equation, we'll follow these steps:

Step 1: Subtract \(2x\) from both sides to isolate \(x\) on one side.
\[
3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x \\
x + 5 = 10
\]

Step 2: Subtract \(5\) from both sides to solve for \(x\).
\[
x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5 \\
x = 5
\]

So, the solution to the equation is \(x = 5\).

Solving Equations by Combining Like Terms

When an equation involves multiple terms with the same variable, combining like terms can simplify the equation, making it easier to solve.

Example 2

Consider the equation: \(2x + 3 - x = 5x - 2\). Let's combine the like terms on each side:

Step 1: Combine the like terms on the left side.
\[
2x + 3 - x = x + 3 = 5x - 2
\]

Step 2: Subtract \(x\) from both sides to isolate \(x\).
\[
x + 3 - x = 5x - 2 - x \\
3 = 4x - 2
\]

Step 3: Add \(2\) to both sides to solve for \(x\).
\[
3 + 2 = 4x - 2 + 2 \\
5 = 4x
\]

Step 4: Divide by \(4\) to find the value of \(x\).
\[
\frac{5}{4} = x
\]

So, the solution to the equation is \(x = \frac{5}{4}\).

 Solving Equations Using Distribution

Distribution, also known as the distributive property, allows us to simplify equations by distributing a value across terms within parentheses.

Example 3

Let's work with the equation: \(2(x + 3) = 4x - 6\). Here's how we solve it using distribution:

Step 1: Distribute \(2\) on the left side.
\[
2 \cdot x + 2 \cdot 3 = 2x + 6 = 4x - 6
\]

Step 2: Subtract \(2x\) from both sides.
\[
2x + 6 - 2x = 4x - 6 - 2x \\
6 = 2x - 6
\]

Step 3: Add \(6\) to both sides.
\[
6 + 6 = 2x - 6 + 6 \\
12 = 2x
\]

Step 4: Divide by \(2\) to find the value of \(x\).
\[
\frac{12}{2} = x \\
6 = x
\]

The solution to the equation is \(x = 6\).
