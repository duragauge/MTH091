<h1>4.2 Factorable Equations</h1>
<p>An equation containing a polynomial where the highest power on the variable is 2 is called a <strong>quadratic equation</strong>. Sometimes the easiest method of solving a quadratic equation is by factoring. Recall that factoring means finding expressions that can be multiplied together to give the original polynomial. When we factor, we change an expression that is the<strong><em> sum</em></strong> of terms into an expression that is the <strong><em>product</em></strong> of terms.</p>
<p>For example, the quadratic equation \(x^2+8x+15=0\)can be factored and written as: \((x+5)(x+3)=0\).</p>
<p>Solving by factoring depends on the <strong>zero-product property</strong>, which states that if \(a \cdot b = 0\), then \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers or algebraic expressions. In other words, if the product of two numbers or two expressions equals zero, then one of the numbers or one of the expressions <em>must equal zero</em> because zero multiplied by anything equals zero.</p>
<p><strong>Zero-Product Property</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If \(a \cdot b = 0 \), then \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers or algebraic expressions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>(a) Solve for\(x\).\((x+3)(x-7)=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> Applying the zero-product property, we know that either</p>
<p>\(x+3=0\) or\(x-7=0\)</p>
<p>We can solve each of these linear equations using one step.</p>
<p>\(x+3=0-&gt;x=-3\)</p>
<p>\(x-7=0-&gt;x=7\)</p>
<p>So the solutions are \(x = -3\) and \(x = 7\).</p>
<p>(b)Solve for\(x\). \(2x(3x-4)=0\)</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> Applying the zero-product property, we know that either</p>
<p>\(2x=0\) or\(3x-4=0\)</p>
<p>We can solve each of these linear equations. For the first, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.</p>
<p>\((2x)/2 = 0/2\)</p>
<p>\(x=0\)</p>
<p>We solve the second equation with two steps. First add 4 to both sides of the equation, then divide by 3.</p>
<p>\(3x-4+4=0+4\)</p>
<p>\(3x=4\)</p>
<p>\(x=3/4\)</p>
<p>So the solutions are: \(x\) = 0 and \(x\) = 3/4.</p>
<p>In Example 1, the given equations were already in factored form. However, you will often need to find the factored form yourself.</p>
<h6>Solving a Quadratic Equation by Factoring</h6>
<p>Given a quadratic equation that has a factorable expression when set equal to 0, we solve it by following these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set the equation equal to zero (if not already done).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factor the polynomial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solve using the zero-product property by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>Factor and solve the equation:\(x^2+x-6=0\)</p>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>To factor, we look for two numbers whose product equals -6 and whose sum equals 1. These numbers are 3 and -2. Note that only one pair of numbers will work. Next, we write the factors:</p>
<p>\((x - 2)(x + 3) = 0\)</p>
<p>By the zero-product property, one or both of these factors must be 0. We set each factor equal to zero and solve.</p>
<p>\(x - 2 = 0 \)or \(x + 3 = 0\)</p>
<p>\(x = 2\) or \(x = -3\)</p>
<p>We can check our solutions in the original equation as follows:</p>
<p>Check \(x\) = 2: \((2)^2+2-6=4+2-6=0\)</p>
<p>Check \(x\) = -3:\((3)^2+-3-6=9-3-6=0\)</p>
<p>In both cases, we get a true statement, which means that both 2 and -3 are solutions to the original equation.</p>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Solve the quadratic equations by factoring. Remember, you can check your solution(s).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>\(x^2-100=0\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(4x^2=28x\)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\(x^3+14x^2+45x=0\)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<ol>
<li>The polynomial in the equation has the form of the difference of squares. It factors to give:</li>
</ol>
<p>\(x^2-100=(x+10)(x-10)=0\)</p>
<p>By the zero product property:</p>
<p>\(x\) + 10 = 0 or \(x\) - 10 = 0</p>
<p>\(x\) = 10 or \(x\) = -10.</p>
<p>2. First, set the equation equal to 0 by subtracting the term 28\(x\) from both sides of the equation.</p>
<p>\(4x^2-28x=0\)</p>
<p>The GCF of the polynomial is \(4x\) so the equation can be written in factor form:</p>
<p>\(4x(x-7)=0\)</p>
<p>Using the zero product property we know:</p>
<p>4\(x\) = 0 or \(x\) - 7 = 0</p>
<p>So \(x\) = 0 or \(x\) = 7</p>
<p>3. TheGCF of the polynomial is \(x\) so the equation can be written in factor form:</p>
<p>\(x^3+14x^2+45x=x(x^2+14x+45)=0\)</p>
<p>We factor the trinomial further into two binomials.</p>
<p>\(x(x+9)(x+5)=0\)</p>
<p>Expanding the zero product property to a product of three factors we know:</p>
<p>\(x = 0\) or \(x + 5 = 0\) or \(x + 9 = 0\)</p>
<p>So there are three solutions: \(x\) = 0 or \(x\) = -5 or \(x\) = -9</p>
<p>You can check all three solutions in the original equation.</p>
